**Ambitious**  æmˈbɪʃ.əs
1. 释义
having a strong wish to be **successful**, powerful, or rich
having a desire to **achieve** a particular **goal**
有抱负的；志向远大的；雄心勃勃的
同义词, **aspiration**, intention, goal, aim, objective, object, purpose, intent, plan, scheme, mission, calling, vocation, desire, wish, design, target, end, dream, hope
2. 词源
late 14c., "**craving**, **yearning**, overambitious," from Latin ambitiosus "eager for public office, eager to win favor, ingratiating," from ambitio "a going around (to solicit votes)," noun of action from past participle stem of ambire "to go around, go about," from amb- "around" (from PIE root *ambhi- "around") + ire "go" (from PIE root *ei- "to go"). Meaning "springing from ambition" is from 1751. Related: Ambitiously; ambitiousness.
ambition源自拉丁语ambitio，意思是“四处走”，其中的词根amb-表示“四处、周围”，it-表示“走”。
ambition原本仅指政客四处奔走发表演说拉选票的行为。
在古罗马时期，谋求官职的人就像今天参加竞选活动的人一样，到处发表演说争取选票。政客拉选票自然是为了实现自己的政治抱负，所以ambition从“四处走”的基本意义中引申出“野心、政治抱负”的含义，原本含有贬义，但现在已经变成中性词，既可以指“野心”，也可以指“雄心、志向”。

Old English cræft ‘strength, skill’, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch kracht, German Kraft, and Swedish kraft **‘strength**’. craft (sense 3 of the noun), originally in the expression small craft ‘small trading vessels’, may be elliptical, referring to vessels requiring a small amount of ‘craft’ or skill to handle, as opposed to large ocean-going ships.
**Etymology**
Old English cræft (West Saxon, Northumbrian), -creft (Kentish), originally "**power**, physical strength, might," from Proto-Germanic *krab-/*kraf- (source also of Old Frisian kreft, Old High German chraft, German Kraft "strength, skill;" Old Norse kraptr "strength, virtue"). Sense expanded in Old English to include "skill, dexterity; art, science, talent" (via a notion of "mental power"), which led by late Old English to the meaning "trade, handicraft, calling," also "something built or made." The word still was used for "might, power" in Middle English.

**OED Origin**
Mid 16th century: from Latin successus, from the verb succedere ‘come close after’ (see succeed).
**Etymology**
1530s, "result, outcome," from Latin successus "an advance, a coming up; a good result, happy outcome," noun use of past participle of succedere "come after, follow after; go near to; come under; take the place of," also "go from under, mount up, ascend," hence "get on well, prosper, be victorious," from sub "next to, after" (see sub-) + cedere "go, move" (from PIE root *ked- "to go, yield"). Meaning "accomplishment of desired end" (good success) first recorded 1580s. Meaning "a thing or person which succeeds," especially in public, is from 1882.
The moral flabbiness born of the bitch-goddess SUCCESS. That -- with the squalid interpretation put on the word success -- is our national disease. [William James to H.G. Wells, Sept. 11, 1906]
Success story is attested from 1902. Among the French phrases reported by OED as in use in English late 19c. were succès d'estime "cordial reception given to a literary work out of respect rather than admiration" and succès de scandale "success (especially of a work of art) dependent upon its scandalous character."

2. 词源,
**Origin**
Middle English (in the sense ‘complete successfully’): from Old French achever ‘come or bring to a head’, from a chief ‘to a head’.
**Etymology**
early 14c., "to perform, execute, accomplish;" late 14c., "gain as a result of effort," from Old French achever (12c.) "to finish, accomplish, complete," from phrase à chef (venir) "at an end, finished," or Vulgar Latin *accapare, from Late Latin ad caput (venire); both the French and Late Latin phrases meaning literally "to come to a head," from ad **"to" (see ad-) + stem of Latin caput "head" (from PIE root *kaput- "head").**
The Lat. caput, towards the end of the Empire, and in Merov[ingian] times, took the sense of an end, whence the phrase ad caput venire, in the sense of to come to an end .... Venire ad caput naturally produced the Fr. phrase venir à chef = venir à bout. ... From this chief, O.Fr. form of chef (q.v.) in sense of term, end, comes the Fr. compd. achever = venir à chef, to end, finish. [Auguste Brachet, "An Etymological Dictionary of the French Language," transl. G.W. Kitchin, Oxford, 1878]

**Adventure** 简写为 venture
1. 助记,
词根venire(go or come)
venture可以理解为went的名词,
Ad(to) + venture(wenture)
to go
2. 词源,
ad "to" (see ad-) + venire "to come," to arrive
**OED Origin**
Middle English: from Old French aventure (noun), aventurer (verb), based on Latin adventurus ‘about to happen’, from advenire ‘arrive’.
**Etymology**
c. 1200, aventure, auenture "that which happens by chance, fortune, luck," from Old French aventure (11c.) "chance, accident, occurrence, event, happening," from Latin adventura (res) "(a thing) about to happen," from fem. of adventurus, future participle of advenire "to come to, reach, arrive at," from ad "to" (see ad-) + venire "to come," from a suffixed form of PIE root *gwa- "to go, come."
	Meaning developed through "risk; danger" (a trial of one's chances), c. 1300, and "perilous undertaking" (late 14c.) to "novel or exciting incident, remarkable occurrence in one's life" (1560s). Earlier it also meant "a wonder, a miracle; accounts of marvelous things" (13c.). The -d- was restored in English 15c.-16c.; attempt was made about the same time to restore it in French, but there it was rejected. Venture is a 15c. variant. German Abenteuer is a borrowing of the French word, apparently deformed by influence of Abend "evening."

an undertaking usually involving danger and unknown risks
