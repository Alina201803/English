"a work, composition," especially a musical one, 1809, from Latin opus "a work, labor, exertion" (source of Italian opera, French oeuvre, Spanish obra), from Proto-Italic *opi-, from PIE root *op- "to work, produce in abundance." **The plural**, seldom used as such, is opera.

**Operate**
1. 词源, opera的动词, 
付出努力得到结果, work 
 oper- ‘work
**Origin**
Early 17th century: from Latin operat- ‘done by labour’, from the verb operari, from opus, oper- ‘work’.
**Etymology**
c. 1600, "to be in effect," back-formation from operation (q.v.), or else from Latin operatus, past participle of operari "to work, **labor**, toil, take pains" (in Late Latin "**to have effect**, be active, cause"). Surgical sense is first attested 1799. Meaning "to work machinery" is from 1864 in American English. Related: Operated; operating. **Operating** system in the computer sense is from 1961.
2. 记忆, opera(复数) + ate
 to have effect, 这个单词强调的是要有结果,操作后要有结果,结果导向.
operate, 可以当做, power, efforts, effect, labor 等的合体,付出努力得到结果.
进一步联想, 微软的操作系统为什么是 Operating system 而不是working system或者opusating system
是因为构成操作系统的是很多程序,而不是一个程序.
可见, operate在做动词(操作), 用的是指的是操作的是比较复杂的机器.划火柴肯定不能说是Operate火柴.
而动手术却是Operation, 作为名词用(手术), 同样也是有繁复的工序.

1. 词源,
com- ‘together’ + prehendere ‘grasp
**Origin** 
Middle English: from Old French comprehender, or Latin comprehendere, from com- ‘together’ + prehendere ‘grasp’, catch .
**Etymology**
mid-14c., "to understand," from Latin comprehendere "to take together, to unite; include; seize" (of catching fire or the arrest of criminals); 
also "to comprehend, perceive" (to seize or take in the mind), from com "with, together," here "completely" (see com-) + prehendere "to catch hold of, seize" (see prehensile). Related: Comprehended; comprehending. Compare sense development in German begriefen, literally "to seize," but, through the writings of the 14c. mystics, "to seize with the mind, to comprehend."
> **prehensile (adj.)**  
> pre-(before), ghend(to grasp)  
> 一种猜测是源于拉丁语hedera "ivy,”常青藤, 常青藤向上攀爬需要抓住附着物,  
> 1771, from French préhensile "adapted for grasping" (Buffon), from Latin prehensus, past participle of prehendere "to grasp, seize, get hold of," from prae- "before" (see pre-) + -hendere, from PIE root ***ghend**- "to seize, take" (see get (v.)).  
> Latin -hendere perhaps is related to hedera **"ivy,"** via the notion of "clinging." De Vaan writes, "Of course, ivy is a climbing (or ground-creeping) plant, and one may surmise that its name means 'the **grabbing** one', but this is just a guess, especially since the morphology is uncommon: no s-stem of this root is attested elsewhere in IE."
