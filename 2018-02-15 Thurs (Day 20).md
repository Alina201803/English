宽恕和放下是送给自己和别人的礼物.
2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Mid 19th century: from Latin condonare ‘refrain from punishing’, from con- ‘altogether’ + donare ‘give’.
**Etymology**
1857, from Latin **condonare** "to give up, remit, permit," from com-, intensive prefix (see com-), + donare "give as a gift," from donum "gift," from PIE *donum "gift," from root *do- "to give." Originally a legal term in the Matrimonial Causes Act, which made divorce a civil matter in Britain. Related: Condoned; condoning.

**Render** /ˈren.dɚ/
1. 助记,
  Ren(repeat) + der(give)
  Render is give

2. 词源,
  from red- "back" (see re-) + combining form of dare "to give" (from PIE root *do- "to give").
  **OED Origin**
  Late Middle English: from Old French rendre, from an alteration of Latin reddere ‘give back’, from re- ‘back’ + dare ‘give’. The earliest senses were ‘recite’, ‘**translate**’, and ‘give back’ (hence ‘represent’ and ‘perform’); ‘hand over’ (hence ‘give help’ and ‘submit for consideration’); ‘cause to be’; and ‘melt down’.
  **Etymology**
  late 14c., "repeat, say again," from Old French **rendre "give back, present, yield"** (10c.), from Vulgar Latin *rendere (formed by dissimilation or on analogy of its antonym, **prendre "to take"**), from Latin reddere "give back, return, restore," from red- "back" (see re-) + combining form of dare "to give" (from PIE root *do- "to give").
  Meaning "hand over, deliver" is recorded from late 14c.; "to return" (thanks, a verdict, etc.) is attested from late 15c.; meaning "represent, depict" is first attested 1590s. Irregular retention of -er in a French verb in English is perhaps to avoid confusion with native rend (v.) or by influence of a Middle English legalese noun render "a payment of rent," from French noun use of the infinitive. Related: Rendered; rendering.

  4)  to transmit to another **: **[deliver](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deliver)b **: **[give up](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/give%20up), [yield](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/yield)c **: **to furnish for consideration, approval, or information: such as (1) **: **to hand down (a legal judgment) (2) **: **to agree on and report (a verdict)

**Hazard** /ˈhæz.ɚd/
1. 词典：
1) 危险物，危害物 something that is dangerous and likely to cause damage
2) 健康／火灾隐患a health/fire hazard
The busy traffic entrance was a hazard to pedestrians.
那个繁忙的车辆入口处对行人来说很不安全。
2. 助记：bio+hazard
3. 词源:
**OED Origin**
Middle English (in hazard (sense 3 of the noun)): from Old French hasard, from Spanish azar, from Arabic az-zahr ‘chance, luck’, from Persian zār or Turkish zar **‘dice’.**
**Etymology**
c. 1300, name of a game at dice, from Old French hasard, hasart "game of chance played with dice," also "a throw of six in dice" (12c.), of uncertain origin. Possibly from Spanish azar "an unfortunate card or throw at dice," which is said to be from Arabic az-zahr (for al-zahr) "the die." But this is doubtful because of the absence of zahr in classical Arabic dictionaries. Klein suggests Arabic yasara "he played at dice;" Arabic -s- regularly becomes Spanish -z-. The -d was added in French through confusion with the native suffix -ard. Sense evolved in French to "chances in gambling," then "chances in life." In English, sense of "chance of loss or harm, risk" first recorded 1540s.
