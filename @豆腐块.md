She is portrayed as a passionate woman of great beauty. Her name is popular among those who want to mark their African roots. Also the name of a fourth-century Palestinian saint.

  *clavicle (n.)*
  "collarbone," 1610s, from Middle French clavicule "collarbone" (16c.), also "small key," from Medieval Latin clavicula "collarbone" (used c. 980 in a translation of Avicenna), special use of classical Latin clavicula, literally "small key, bolt," diminutive of clavis "key" (from PIE root *klau- "hook"); in the anatomical sense a loan-translation of Greek kleis "key, collarbone," which is from the same PIE source. So called supposedly from its function as the "fastener" of the shoulder. Related: Clavicular.

This cooperative verb is sometimes referred to by linguists as *es-*wes-. Until the distinction broke down 13c., *es-*wes- tended to express "existence," with beon meaning something closer to "come to be."Old English am had two plural forms: 1. sind/sindon, sie and 2. earon/aron. The s- form (also used in the subjunctive) fell from English in the early 13c. (though its cousin continues in German sind, the 3rd person plural of "to be") and was replaced by forms of be, but aron (see [are](https://www.etymonline.com/word/are?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) continued, and as am and be merged it encroached on some uses that previously had belonged to be. By the early 1500s it had established its place in standard English.

2. 词源,

   **Origin**

   Late Middle English (denoting the Apostles' Creed): from Latin symbolum ‘symbol, Creed (as the mark of a Christian)’, from Greek sumbolon ‘mark, token’, **from sun- ‘with’ + ballein ‘to throw’.**

   **Etymology**

   early 15c., "creed, summary, religious belief," from Late Latin symbolum "creed, token, mark," from Greek symbolon "token, watchword, sign by which one infers; ticket, a permit, licence" (the word was applied c.250 by Cyprian of Carthage to the Apostles' Creed, on the notion of the "mark" that distinguishes Christians from pagans), literally "that which is thrown or cast together," **from assimilated form of syn- "together" (see [syn-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/syn-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + bole "a throwing, a casting, the stroke of a missile, bolt, beam,"** from bol-, nominative stem of ballein "to throw" (from PIE root [*gwele-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*gwele-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to throw, reach").The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" first recorded 1590 (in "Faerie Queene"). As a written character, 1610s.

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Middle English: from Old Frech compas (noun), compasser (verb), based on Latin com- ‘together’ + passus ‘a step or pace’. Several senses (‘measure’, ‘artifice’, ‘circumscribed area’, and ‘pair of compasses’) which appeared in Middle English are also found in Old French, but their development and origin are uncertain. The transference of sense to the magnetic compass is held to have occurred in the related Italian word compasso, from the circular shape of the compass box.

   **Etymology**

   c. 1300, "space, area, extent, circumference," from Old French compas "circle, radius; size, extent; pair of compasses" (12c.), from compasser "to go around, measure (with a compass); divide equally," from Vulgar Latin *compassare "to pace out," from Latin com "with, together" (see [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + passus "a step" (from PIE root [*pete-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*pete-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to spread").The mathematical instrument for describing circles was so called in English from mid-14c. The mariners' directional tool (so called since early 15c.) took the name, perhaps, because it's round and has a point like the mathematical instrument.Meaning "limits, boundary" is from 1550s. Sense of "range of notes which a given voice or instrument can produce" is from 1590s. The word is in most European languages, with a mathematical sense in Romance, a nautical sense in Germanic, and both in English. In Middle English it also could mean "ingenuity, subtlety, cunning." Also an adverb in Middle English: to go compass was "go in a circle, go around."

   [Parameter - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter)

   **Computer programming**

   In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), two notions of [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)) are commonly used, and are referred to as [parameters and arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments)—or more formally as a **formal parameter** and an **actual parameter**.

   For example, in the definition of a function such as

   `y = f(x) = x + 2,`


   *x* is the *formal parameter* (the *parameter*) of the defined function.

   When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in

   `f(3): or, y = f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,`


    is the *actual parameter* (the *argument*) for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the *formal parameter* of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms *parameter* and *argument* might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)

   These concepts are discussed in a more precise way in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and its foundational disciplines, [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) and [combinatory logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic). Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) define parameter and argument as given here, while [Eiffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)) uses an [alternative convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Alternative_convention_in_Eiffel).

   In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.

   > Parameters appear in procedure definitions; arguments appear in procedure calls. In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. **Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.**

    **Mathematical functions[[edit source](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=1)]**

   [Mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_function) have one or more [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function) that are designated in the definition by [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)). A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general [quadratic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function) by declaring


   here, the variable *x* designates the function's argument, but *a*, *b*, and *c* are parameters that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-*b* logarithm by the formula
