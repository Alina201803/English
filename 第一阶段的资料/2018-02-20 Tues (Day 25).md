> 今天分享两个关于舞蹈的单词：flamenco和tango。表演形式同样激情，但一个偏重于女人的妩媚与感性，另一个则偏重于男女双方的缠绵与奔放。  
 *Tango** [Tango - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tango)
1. 助记
**可联想到同音异形词tangle(纠缠、扭缠在一起)。** 😆😆😆

电影“Scent of a woman”(《闻香识女人》)中，老上校对探戈的经典定义——“If you make a mistake, get all tangled up, just tango on.” 如果（探戈）跳错了，那就让大家的舞步都混乱好了，这才是探戈。
2. 词源
摘自牛津词典：
Origin
Late 19th century: from Latin American Spanish, perhaps of African origin.
摘自词源网站：
syncopated ballroom dance, 1913 (the year it became a rage in Britain and America), from Argentine Spanish tango, originally the name of an African-South American drum dance, probably from a Niger-Congo language (compare Ibibio tamgu "to dance"). Phrase it takes two to tango was a song title from 1952. As a verb from 1913. Related: Tangoed.
探戈(tango)是一种双人舞蹈，起源于非洲中西部的一种民间舞蹈探戈诺舞。19世纪，大量欧洲和非洲移民涌入阿根廷，探戈开始流行，并被阿根廷人视为国粹。探戈一般要男女对跳，男人粗犷、女人妖冶，构成了探戈舞的巨大张力。这种舞蹈当时被认为是上流社会的色情面具，同时也是草根阶层释放欲望的最好方式。

3. 释义
n. 探戈舞，探戈舞曲an energetic dance from South America for two people, or the music for this dance

**Flamenco** /fləˈmeŋ.koʊ/  [Flamenco - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flamenco)
1. 助记
fla(来自阿拉伯词汇felag，意思是“农夫”)+menco(来自阿拉伯词汇mengu，意思是“流浪的”)
其中的flame，我们可以想象到，弗拉明戈那犹如火焰般热情的表演形式。\
@董长青 flame(火焰 ) + nco

2. 词源
摘自牛津词典：
Origin
Late 19th century: Spanish, ‘like a Gypsy’, literally ‘Fleming’, from Middle Dutch Vlaminc.
摘自词源网站：
1882, from Spanish flamenco, first used of Gypsy dancing in Andalusia. The word in Spanish meant "a Fleming, native of Flanders" (Dutch Vlaming) and also "flamingo." Speculation are varied and colorful about the connection between the bird, the people, and the gypsy dance of Andalusia.
弗拉明戈舞蹈是吉普赛文化和西班牙的安达卢西亚民间文化的结合。其起源包括了安达卢西亚的许多不同的文化形式，主要的影响是从9世纪到15世纪的阿拉伯、印度、犹太的和拜占庭的文化影响，安达卢西亚的吉普赛人同样在弗拉明戈舞蹈的发展过程中起到了主要的作用。15世纪，吉普赛人开始迁居到安达卢西亚，他们的血统不是非常分明，但可以相信，他们可能来自印度或是古代以色列王国“失去的部落”的部分成员。
因为犹太人、阿拉伯人、吉普赛人在16世纪都是当时作为统治者的基督教西班牙人的共同敌人，他们聚集在一起，Flamenco作为艺术和生活的哲学而形成。这个没有家园的集体与“felag-mengu”的概念非常吻合。随着流浪的农夫与基督教西班牙人的通婚，产生了安达卢西亚人，“felag-mengu”这个词被纯正地西班牙语化，而变成了“flamenco”。从这个词本身可以看出，基督教西班牙人也影响了这种艺术，并使之成为完整的弗拉门哥文化的构成部分。
3. 释义
n. 弗拉明戈舞(一种西班牙舞，节奏快而强烈，吉他伴奏)a type of dancing where carefully organized movements tell a story or express an idea, or a theatre work that uses this type of dancinga type of Spanish dance music, or the dance performed to this music

Phantom /ˈfæn təm/
1. 助记
A ghost.
‘a phantom who haunts lonely roads’
as modifier ‘a phantom ship’
2. 词源
n. 幻影
phantom (n.)
c. 1300, fantum "illusion, unreality," from Old French fantosme (12c.), from Vulgar Latin *fantauma, from Latin phantasma "an apparition," from Greek phantasma "image, phantom, apparition; mere image, unreality," from phantazein "to make visible, display," from stem of phainein "to bring to light, make appear," from PIE root *bha- (1) "to shine." The ph- was restored in English late 16c. (see ph). Meaning "specter, spirit, ghost" is attested from late 14c.; that of "something having the form, but not the substance, of a real thing" is from 1707. As an adjective from early 15c.
3. 释义
phan‧tom 1 [C] / 'fæntəm  ; ˋfæntəm  / literary
phantom  /phantom/1a ghostly appearing figure
同义词：apparition / phantasm / phantasma / fantasm / specter / spectre2something existing in perception only
同义词：apparition / phantasm / phantasma / fantasm / shadow1something apparently sensed but having no physical reality
seemed to hear faint phantom bells ; the amputee's illusion of a phantom limb ; 

@董长青
phantom和apparition来表示幽灵鬼魂。
这两个词侧重形容幻影、虚无缥缈的东西，所以自然也很喜欢被人用在移动迅速的东西上面。
比如劳斯莱斯幻影和大疆精灵：
例句：
They vanished down the stairs like two phantoms. 他们像两个幽灵般消失在楼梯中。
Now I stared at this sudden apparition.现在，我盯着这个突然出现的小东西。
其实英语里面有很多不同的词儿来形容各种幽灵鬼怪，今天就给大家伙儿讲几个~
比如sprite和devil，虽然都是鬼，但是给人的印象则完全不同。
sprite是调皮鬼、小精灵，而devil是凶神恶煞的夜叉。
所以前者被用在雪碧的命名上，给人一种清爽宜人的感觉。
而后者常被用在球队的队徽中，意味着自己绝不好惹。
再比如说专门形容吸血鬼的vampire，形容梦魇的spectre（缠绕心头的恐惧）。
例句：
The terrible spectre of civil war hung over the country once again.
内战的可怕阴影再一次笼罩这个国家。

	As a preposition, between two numbers to indicate addition, from 1660s. [Barnhart writes that this sense "did not exist in Latin and probably originated in commercial language of the Middle Ages."] Placed after a whole number to indicate "and a little more," it is attested from 1902. As a conjunction, "and," it is American English colloquial, attested from 1968. As a noun meaning "an advantage" from 1791. Plus fours (1921) were four inches longer in the leg than standard knickerbockers, to produce an overhang, originally a style associated with golfers. The plus sign itself has been well-known at least since late 15c. and is perhaps an abbreviation of Latin et (see et cetera).

**Concrete** 具体的,具象的. 名词(混凝土)
1. 助记,
向混凝土一样具体.
 literally "grown together”
"building material made from cement, etc."
2. 词源,
concrescere ‘grow together’. 
**OED Origin**
Late Middle English (in the sense ‘solidified’): from French concret or Latin concretus, past participle of concrescere ‘grow together’. Early use was also as a grammatical term designating a quality belonging to a substance (usually expressed by an adjective such as white in white paper) as opposed to the quality itself (expressed by an abstract noun such as whiteness); later concrete came to be used to refer to nouns embodying attributes (e.g. fool, hero), as opposed to the attributes themselves (e.g. foolishness, heroism), and this is the basis of the modern use as the opposite of ‘abstract’. The noun sense ‘building material’ dates from the mid 19th century.
**concrete (adj.)**
late 14c., "actual, solid," from Latin concretus "condensed, hardened, thick, hard, stiff, curdled, congealed, clotted," figuratively "thick; dim," literally "grown together;" past participle of concrescere "to grow together," from **com- "together" (see com-) + crescere "to grow" (from PIE root *ker- (2) "to grow")**. A logicians' term until meaning began to expand 1600s. Noun sense of "building material made from cement, etc." is first recorded 1834.
3. 释义,
1) 混凝土 a very hard building material made by mixing together cement, sand, small stones, and water
2) 确定的，确实的；具体的，有形的，实在的 clear and certain, or real and existing in a form that can be seen or felt
4. 拓展,
Cement
1) 水泥(BUILDING MATERIAL)a grey powder that is mixed with water and sand to make mortar or with water, sand, and small stones to make concrete

**Spell**
1. 助记,
2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Middle English: shortening of Old French espeller, from the Germanic base of spell.
**spell (v.1)**
early 14c., **"read letter by letter**, write or say the letters of;" c. 1400, "form words by means of letters," apparently a French word that merged with or displaced a native Old English one; both are from the same Germanic root, but the French word had evolved a different sense. The native word is Old English spellian "to tell, speak, discourse, talk," from Proto-Germanic *spellam (source also of Old High German spellon "to tell," Old Norse spjalla, Gothic spillon "to talk, tell"), from **PIE *spel- (2) "to say aloud, recite."**
	But the current senses seem to come from Anglo-French espeller, Old French espelir "mean, signify, explain, interpret," also "spell out letters, pronounce, recite," from Frankish *spellon "to tell" or some other Germanic source, ultimately identical with the native word.
