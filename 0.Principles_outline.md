## Vocabulary



**Heaven** /ˈhev.ən/ 天空

1. 助记,
   hide,sky

2. 词源,
   **OED Origin**

   Old English heofon, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch hemel and German Himmel.
   **Etymology**

   Old English heofon "home of God," earlier "the visible sky, firmament," probably from Proto-Germanic*hibin-, dissimilated from *himin- (cognates Low German heben, Old Norse himinn, Gothic himins, Old Frisian himul, Dutch hemel, **German Himmel "heaven, sky"),** which is of uncertain origin. Perhaps literally "a covering," from a PIE root *kem- "to cover" (also proposed as the source of [chemise](https://www.etymonline.com/word/chemise?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Watkins derives it elaborately from PIE *ak- "sharp" via *akman- "stone, sharp stone," then "stony vault of heaven."

3. 释义,
   天空 in some religions, the place, sometimes imagined to be in the sky

4. 拓展
