**Philosophy**
```
哲学这个词的英文是philosophy，
这个词的来源在古希腊那里是philo-sophia，也即爱（philo）智慧（sophia）的意思，所以一般说谈哲学就是爱智慧。
```
1. 词源, 
From philo- "loving" (see philo-) + sophia "knowledge, wisdom," from sophis "wise, learned;"
`ph`即`f`, 法语拼写为 ` filosofie`
‘philos’在希腊语中, 形容词含义是’dear’ ,名词是’friend’

Philosophy (from Greek φιλοσοφία, philosophia, **literally "love of wisdom**"[1][2][3][4]) is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters **such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language**.[5][6] The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570–495 BCE). Philosophical methods include **questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.**[7][8] Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it?[9][10][11] What is most real? Philosophers also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?[12] Do humans have **free** will?[13]
