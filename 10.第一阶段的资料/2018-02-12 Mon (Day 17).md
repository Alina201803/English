**Teenager**
1. 助记
Teen + ager
teen(应源于“ten”，n.①青少年；②伤害，痛苦；adj.十几岁的)+age(应源于edage，n.年龄；时代；v.(使)长大，变老；[化学]老化)
2. 词源
**teen**
word-forming element making cardinal numbers from 13 to 19, meaning "ten more than," from Old English -tene, -tiene, from Proto-Germanic *tekhuniz (cognates: Old Saxon -tein, Dutch -tien, Old High German -zehan, German -zehn, Gothic -taihun), an inflected form of the root of ten; cognate with Latin -decim (source of Italian -dici, Spanish -ce, French -ze).
**age**
late 13c., "long but indefinite period in human history," from Old French aage, eage (12c., Modern French âge) "age; life, lifetime, lifespan; maturity," earlier edage (11c.), from Vulgar Latin *aetaticum (source also of Spanish edad, Italian eta, Portuguese idade "age"), extended form of Latin aetatem (nominative aetas), "period of life, age, lifetime, years," from aevum "lifetime, eternity, age," from PIE root *aiw- "vital force, life; long life, eternity"
3. 释义
n.青少年时期；adj.十几岁的(指13到19岁);青少年的
11是eleven，12是twelve，
从13开始，一直到19，后缀均用teen，因此不难理解，teenage是指13至19岁的青少年。

Adolescent /ˌæd.əˈles.ənt/
1. 释义：
青少年 ,a young person who is developing into an adult
2. 词源：
From Latin adolescentem/adulescentem (nominative adolescens/adulescens) "young man or woman, a youth,"
摘自牛津词源词典
Late Middle English (as a noun): via French from Latin adolescent- ‘coming to maturity’, from adolescere, from ad- ‘to’ + alescere ‘grow, grow up’, from **alere ‘nourish**’. The adjective dates from the late 18th century.
摘自词源词典,
mid-15c., "youth, young person, one who is growing up," from Middle French adolescent (15c.) or directly from Latin adolescentem/adulescentem (nominative adolescens/adulescens) "young man or woman, a youth," noun use of an adjective meaning "growing, near maturity, youthful," present participle of adolescere "grow up, come to maturity, ripen," from ad "to" (see ad-) + alescere "be **nourished**," hence, "increase, grow up," inchoative of alere "to nourish," from a suffixed form of PIE root *al- (2) "to grow, nourish." Adolesce was a back-formed verb used early 20c. (OED quotes H.G. Wells, G.B. Shaw, Louis MacNeice), but it seems not to have taken.

adult的现在分词

**Adult** /əˈdʌlt/
1. 助记,
在拉丁语中,Adult是Adolescent的过去分词, 
Adult = ad(to) + grown up v  (拉丁语adolescere)
Adolescent  = ad(to) + grow up (拉丁语 adultus是adolescere的过去分词)
2. 词源,
From Latin adultus "grown up, mature, adult, ripe," 
**OED Origin**
Mid 16th century: from Latin adultus, past participle of adolescere ‘grow to maturity’ (see adolescent).
**Etymology**
1530s (but not common until mid-17c.) "**grown, mature**," from Latin adultus "grown up, mature, adult, ripe," past participle of adolescere "grow up, come to maturity, ripen," from ad "**to" (see ad-) + alescere "be nourished,"** hence, "increase, grow up," inchoative of alere "to nourish," from a suffixed form of PIE root *al- (2) "to grow, nourish."
	Meaning "mature in attitude or outlook" is from 1929. As a euphemism for "pornographic," it dates to 1958 and does no honor to the word. In the old British film-rating system, A indicated "suitable for exhibit to adult audiences," and thus, implicitly, unsuitable for children (1914).

**Read**
1. 助记,  R + ea(一双眼睛) + d
2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Old English rǣdan, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch raden and German raten ‘advise, guess’. Early senses included ‘advise’ and ‘interpret (a riddle or dream’) (see **rede**).
**Etymology**
Old English rædan (West Saxon), redan (Anglian) "**to advise, counsel, persuade; discuss, deliberate**; rule, guide; arrange, equip; forebode; read, explain; learn by reading; put in order" (related to ræd, red "advice"), from Proto-Germanic *redan (source also of Old Norse raða, Old Frisian reda, Dutch raden, Old High German ratan, German raten "to advise, counsel, guess"), **from PIE root *re- "to reason, count."** Words from this root in most modern Germanic languages still mean "counsel, advise" (compare rede). Connected to riddle (n.1) via notion of "interpret."
	Sense of "make out the character of (a person)" is attested from 1610s. Transference to "understand the meaning of written symbols" is unique to Old English and (perhaps under English influence) Old Norse raða. Most languages use a word rooted in the idea of "gather up" as their word for "read" (such as French lire, from Latin legere). Read up "study" is from 1842; read out (v.) "expel by proclamation" (Society of Friends) is from 1788. read-only in computer jargon is recorded from 1961.

**OED Origin**
Old English wrītan ‘**score**, form (letters) by carving, write’, of Germanic origin; related to German reissen ‘sketch, drag’.
**Etymology**
Old English writan "to score, outline, draw the figure of," later "to set down in writing" (class I strong verb; past tense wrat, past participle writen), from Proto-Germanic *writan "tear, scratch" (source also of Old Frisian writa "to write," Old Saxon writan "to tear, scratch, write," Old Norse rita "write, scratch, outline," Old High German rizan "to write, scratch, tear," German reißen "to tear, pull, tug, sketch, draw, design"), outside connections doubtful.
	For men use to write an evill turne in marble stone, but a good turne in the dust. [More, 1513]
Words for "write" in most Indo-European languages originally mean "carve, scratch, cut" (such as Latin scribere, Greek graphein, glyphein, Sanskrit rikh-); a few originally meant "paint" (Gothic meljan, Old Church Slavonic pisati, and most of the modern Slavic cognates). To write (something) off (1680s) originally was from accounting; figurative sense is recorded from 1889. Write-in "unlisted candidate" is recorded from 1932.

2. 词源, 
**OED Origin**
Late Middle English (denoting a spicy sauce served with meat): from Middle Dutch, Middle Low German pekel, of unknown ultimate origin.
**Etymology**
c. 1400, probably from Middle Dutch pekel "pickle, brine," or related words in Low German and East Frisian (Dutch pekel, East Frisian päkel, German pökel), of uncertain origin or original meaning. Klein suggests the name of a medieval Dutch fisherman who developed the process. Originally a sauce served with meat or fowl; meaning **"cucumber preserved in pickle"** first recorded 1707, via use of the word for the salty liquid in which meat, etc. was preserved (c. 1500). Figurative sense of "sorry plight" first recorded 1560s, from the time when the word still meant a sauce served on meat about to be eaten. Meaning "troublesome boy" is from 1788, perhaps from the notion of being "imbued" with roguery.

Pike
3. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Middle English: variant of **pike.**
**Etymology**
early 13c., picken "to peck;" c. 1300, piken "to work with a pick," probably representing a fusion of Old English *pician "to prick," (implied by picung "a piercing, pricking," an 8c. gloss on Latin stigmata) with Old Norse pikka "to prick, peck," both from a Germanic root (source also of Middle Dutch picken, German picken "to pick, peck"), perhaps imitative. Influence from Middle French piquer "to prick, sting" (see pike (n.2)) also is possible, but that French word generally is not considered a source of the English word. Related: Picked; picking.
	Meaning "to eat with small bites" is from 1580s. The meaning "to choose, select, pick out" emerged late 14c., from earlier meaning "to pluck with the fingers" (early 14c.). Sense of "to rob, plunder" (c. 1300) weakened to a milder sense of "steal petty things" by late 14c. Of forcing locks with a pointed tool, by 1540s. Meaning "to pluck (a banjo)" is recorded from 1860. To pick a quarrel, etc. is from mid-15c.; to pick at "find fault with" is from 1670s. Pick on "single out for adverse attention" is from late 14c.; pick off "shoot one by one" is recorded from 1810; baseball sense of "to put out a runner on base" is from 1939. Also see pick up.

**Pike** 矛
1. 助记,
Pike,
3. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Early 16th century: from French pique, back-formation from piquer **‘pierce**’, from pic ‘pick, pike’; compare with Old English pīc ‘point, prick’ (of unknown origin). pike (sense 2 of the noun) is apparently of Scandinavian origin; compare with West Norwegian dialect pīk ‘pointed mountain’.
**Etymology**
**"weapon with a long shaft and a pointed metal head,"** 1510s, from Middle French pique "a spear; pikeman," from piquer "to pick, puncture, **pierce**," from Old French pic "sharp point or spike," a general continental term (Spanish pica, Italian picca, Provençal piqua), perhaps ultimately from a Germanic [Barnhart] or Celtic source (see pike (n.4)). Alternative explanation traces the Old French word (via Vulgar Latin *piccare "to prick, pierce") to Latin picus "woodpecker." "Formerly the chief weapon of a large part of the infantry; in the 18th c. superseded by the bayonet" [OED]; hence old expressions such as pass through pikes "come through difficulties, run the gauntlet;" push of pikes "close-quarters combat." German Pike, Dutch piek, Danish pik, etc. are from French pique.

late 13c. "make a hole in; force one's way through," from Anglo-French perser, Old French percier "pierce, transfix, drive through" (12c., Modern French percer), probably from Vulgar Latin *pertusiare, frequentative of Latin pertusus, past participle of pertundere "to thrust or bore through," from per "through" (from PIE root *per- (1) "forward," hence "through") + tundere "to beat, pound," from PIE *tund-, from root *(s)teu- "to push, strike, knock, beat, thrust" (see obtuse).

**OED  Origin**
Old English fecc(e)an, variant of fetian, probably related to **fatian ‘grasp**’, of Germanic origin and related to German fassen.
**Etymology**
Middle English fecchen, from Old English feccan "to bring, bring to; seek, gain, take," apparently a variant of fetian, fatian "bring near, bring back, obtain; induce; marry," which is probably from Proto-Germanic *fetan (source also of Old Frisian fatia "to grasp, seize, contain," Old Norse feta "to find one's way," Middle Dutch vatten, Old High German sih faggon "to mount, climb," German fassen "to grasp, contain"). This would connect it to the PIE verb for "to walk" derived from root *ped- "foot."
	With widespread sense development: to "reach," "deliver," "effect," "make (butter), churn" (19c.), "restore to consciousness" (1620s), also various nautical senses from 16c.-17c.; meaning "to bring in as equivalent or price" is from c. 1600. In 17c. writers on language didn't derive a word's etymology; they fetched it. As what a dog does, c. 1600, originally fetch-and-carry. Variant form fet, a derivation of the original Old English version of the word, survived as a competitor until 17c. Related: Fetched; fetching.

3. 词源,
词源是way, also to lead, 与现代的含义相差太远.
**OED  Origin**
Old English lād ‘way, journey, conveyance’, of Germanic origin: related to German Leite, **also to lead**; compare with lode. The verb dates from the late 15th century.
**Etymology**
c. 1200, lode, lade "that which is laid upon a person or beast, burden," a sense extension from Old English lad "a way, a course, a carrying; a street, watercourse; maintenance, support," from Proto-Germanic *laitho (source also of Old High German leita, German leite, Old Norse leið "way, road, course"), **from PIE root *leit- (2) "to go forth" (see lead (v.1)).**
	It seems to have expanded its range of senses in early Middle English, supplanting words based on lade (v.), to which it is not etymologically connected. The older senses went with the spelling lode (q.v.). The spelling is modern. Meaning "amount customarily loaded at one time" is from c. 1300; meaning "a quantity of strong drink taken" is from 1590s. Meaning "the charge of a firearm" is from 1690s.
	Meaning "a great amount or number" (often loads) is from c.1600. Figurative sense of "burden weighing on the mind, heart, or soul" is first attested 1590s. Meaning "amount (of work, etc.) to be done by one person" is attested in compounds from 1939 (first was workload). Colloquial loads "lots, heaps" is attested from c. 1600. Phrase take a load off (one's) feet "sit down, relax" is from 1914, American English. Get a load of "take a look at" is American English colloquial, attested from 1929.
