**abyss**
1. 助记
a‧byss [C] / əˈbɪs  ; əˋbɪs  /
n.深渊；深邃，无底洞，地狱
2. 词源
**OED  Origin**
Late Middle English (in the sense ‘infernal pit’): via late Latin from Greek abussos ‘bottomless’, from a- ‘without’ + bussos ‘depth’.
n. 深渊
**Etymology**
late 14c. in Latin form abyssus, "depths of the earth or sea; primordial chaos;" early 14c. as abime "depths of the earth or sea; bottomless pit, Hell" (from Old French; see 
<a href=" ">abysm</a >). Both are from Late Latin abyssus "bottomless pit," from Greek abyssos (limne) "bottomless (pool)," from abyssos "bottomless, unfathomed," hence, generally, "enormous, unfathomable," also as a noun, he abyssos "the great depth, the underworld, the bottomless pit." This is a compound of a- "without" (see 
<a href="https://mn.dancite.com/?x_source=pg_word#/glossary/a-">a-</a > (3)) + byssos "bottom," a word of uncertain origin possibly related to bathos "depth" [Liddell &amp; Scott]. Watkins suggests a connection with the root of bottom (n.); Beekes suggests it is pre-Greek.  The current form in English is a 16c. partial re-Latinization. Greek abyssos was used in Septuagint to translate Hebrew tehom "original chaos" and was used in the New Testament for "Hell." OED notes, "the word has had five variants, abime, abysm, abysmus, abyssus, abyss; of which abyss remains as the ordinary form, and abysm as archaic or poetic." In reference to a seemingly bottomless gulf from 1630s.
3. 释义
abyss  （无底洞）：
基督教中关押反叛天使的无底地狱 英语单词abyss源自希腊语abyssos，由否定前缀a-和byssos（底，bottom）组成，意为“无底洞”。
根据基督教的教义，上帝带圣子基督巡游天界，让众天使向圣子下跪参拜。天界中地位最高的天使长路西法Lucifer拒绝向人类出身的圣子基督臣服，率领三分之一的天使造反。经过三天的激战，圣子基督战胜反叛天使，将其打入永劫的无底洞abyss。除路西法外，所有反叛天使都被除名，蜕变为丑恶形象，只有路西法依然保持六翼天使的光辉形象。被打入无底洞的路西法就是后来的撒旦。
按照但丁在《神曲》中的描写，abyss位于地狱（inferno）的最底层，是关押恶魔和反叛天使的地方。在佛教中，八大地狱中的第八个地狱叫做“阿鼻地狱”，“阿鼻”的意思是“无间”，表示在该地狱中要承受永恒的痛苦，从不间断**。abyss的发音与“阿鼻”很接近，**一个表示基督教中的“无底地狱”，一个表示佛教中的“无间地狱”。

> 董长青: @Penny 看来…byss和base是有联系的  
> Penny: 对啊，并且看到bottom这个词立刻就深刻起来了  
> @arnakin  
> @Penny 因为一部电影记住abyss，詹姆斯卡梅隆的《深渊》，终结者2中，液体机器人T1000的特效技术在卡神深渊这部片子中就已经崭露头角

**OED Origin**
Late Middle English: from Old French s'entreferir ‘strike each other’, from entre- ‘between’ + ferir (from Latin ferire ‘to strike’).
**Etymology**
formerly also enterfere, mid-15c., "to strike against," from Middle French enterferir "exchange blows, strike each other," from entre- "between" (see entre-) + ferir "to strike," from Latin ferire "to knock, strike," related to Latin forare "to bore, pierce" (from PIE root *bhorh- "hole").

tibia（胫骨）
tibianoun [ C ] UK ​ /ˈtɪb.i.ə/ US ​/ˈtɪb.i.ə/ plural tibiae UK ​ /ˈtɪb.i.iː/

1. 释义, US tibias specialized the large bone at the front of the lower leg

这个单词来自于古罗马（拉丁）词汇Tibia，而Tibia又来自希腊语Aulos，是一种古希腊的笛子。用笛子来命名胫骨，是不是很形象呢,现在，Tibia(e) 这个词根仍有泛指一切木管乐器（笛子、单簧管等）意思，如：Tibiaephobia（恐笛症）。

由于我的开发和工业硬件底层直接相关，所以大多数还是基于C语言开发，很多时候还要用到准用的汇编语言甚至01极其语言。
相比发展到今日的高级语言，这些就更没有人情味了。
2006年时的本科毕业设计，用神经网络算法和C语言在DSP上做了一个机器人双目视觉系统，让一个小车在特定场景里实现各种立体几何体的辨别和测距（碰到但不会推倒）。
那时算法还只是单层神经网络，基于多层神经网络的深度学习的理论基础都还没有发表提出来。
人工智能领域当时正出于第二次大低谷，正在选择专业方向的我就放弃了计算机这条路，走向了新能源。
