oscilloscope

1. Interpretation

n. [电子] 示波器；
a device that represents a changing amount on a screen in the form of a line that moves up and down in curves
A device for viewing oscillations by a display on the screen.

2.Origin
"instrument for visually recording an electrical wave," 1915, a hybrid formed from Latin oscillare "to swing" (see oscillation) + -scope.

3.Mnemonic
oscillo-, 
Latin: swing, vibrate, move, motion; from oscillum, a diminutive form of osoris, "mouth, face, small face"
-scope-
Greek > Latin: see, view, sight, look, look at, examine, behold, consider

oscillate -振荡，来回摆动。
以前介绍的各种波，本质就是各种形式的振荡；什么相位幅度偏振，都示波器都能搞定。当然功能远不止这些。

2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Mid 16th century (in initiate (sense 2 of the verb)): from Latin initiat- ‘begun’, from the verb initiare, from initium ‘beginning’.
**Etymology**
*initiate (n.)*
"one who has been initiated" (in secret doctrines, etc.), 1732, from obsolete or archaic past-participle adjective initiate "initiated, instructed in secret knowledge" (c. 1600), from Latin initiatus (see initiate (v.)).
*initiate (v.)*
c. 1600, "introduce to some practice or system," also "begin, set going," from Late Latin initiatus, past participle of initiare "to begin, originate," in classical Latin only in the sense "to instruct in mysteries or sacred knowledge." This is from initium "a beginning; an entrance," also in plural initia "constituent parts; sacred mysteries," a noun use of the neuter past participle of inire "to go into, enter upon, begin," from in- "into, in" (from PIE root *en "in") + ire "to go" (from PIE root *ei- "to go").

**Fork** /fɔːrk/
1. 助记,
Latin furca ‘pitchfork, forked stick’;
2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Old English forca, force (denoting a farm implement), based on Latin furca ‘pitchfork, forked stick’; reinforced in Middle English by Anglo-Norman French furke (also from Latin furca).
**Etymology**
*fork (n.)*
Old English forca, force "pitchfork, forked instrument, forked weapon," from a Germanic borrowing (Old Frisian forke, Dutch vork, Old Norse forkr, Danish fork) of Latin furca "two-pronged fork; pitchfork; fork used in cooking," a word of uncertain origin. Old English also had forcel "pitchfork." From c. 1200 as "forked stake or post" (as a gallows or prop).
	Table forks are said to have been not used among the nobility in England until 15c. and not common until early 17c. The word is first attested in this sense in English in an inventory from 1430, probably from Old North French forque (Old French furche, Modern French fourche), from the Latin word. Of rivers, from 1753; of roads, from 1839. As a bicycle part from 1871. As a chess attack on two pieces simultaneously by one (usually a knight), it dates from 1650s. In old slang, forks "the two forefingers" is from 1812.
*fork (v.)*
early 14c., "to divide in branches, go separate ways," also "disagree, be inconsistent," from fork (n.). Transitive meaning "raise or pitch with a fork" is from 1812. Related: Forked; forking. The slang verb phrase fork (something) over is from 1839 (fork out) "give over" is from 1831). Forking (n.) in the forensic sense "disagreement among witnesses" is from c. 1400.

**Repose** /rɪˈpoʊz/
1. 助记,
from re- "back, away" (see re-) + ponere "to put, place" (past participle positus; see position (n.)). 
2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Late Middle English (in the sense ‘put back in the same position’): from re- ‘again’ + the verb pose, suggested by Latin reponere ‘replace’, from re- (expressing intensive force) + ponere ‘to place’.
**Etymology**
*repose (v.2)*
"put, place," mid-15c., from Latin repos-, stem of reponere "put back, set back, replace, restore; put away, lay out, stretch out," from re- "back, away" (see re-) + ponere "to put, place" (past participle positus; see position (n.)). Or perhaps [Klein] formed in Middle English from Old French poser, on model of disposen "dispose."
3. 释义,
  1) 休息；憩息；卧眠 to rest or lie
  She reposed on the sofa. 她躺在沙发上休息。
  2) ​休息；憩息；卧眠 the state of resting or lying down

**Pattern**
1. 助记,
"to make a pattern for, design, plan,"
2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Middle English patron ‘something serving as a model’, from Old French (see patron). The change in sense is from the idea of a patron giving an example to be copied. Metathesis in the second syllable occurred in the 16th century. By 1700 patron ceased to be used of things, and the two forms became differentiated in sense.
**Etymology**
*pattern (n.)*
early 14c., "outline, plan, model, pattern;" early 15c. as "model of behavior, exemplar," from Old French patron and directly from Medieval Latin patronus (see patron).
Extended sense of **"decorative design"** first recorded 1580s, from earlier sense of **a "patron" as a model to be imitated**. The difference in form and sense between patron and pattern wasn't firm till 1700s. Meaning "model or design in dressmaking" (especially one of paper) is first recorded 1792, in Jane Austen.
*pattern (v.)*
1580s, "to make a pattern for, design, plan," from pattern (n.). Meaning "to make something after a pattern" is c. 1600. Phrase pattern after "take as a model" is from 1878.

Middle English: from Old French, from Latin patronus ‘protector of clients, defender’, from pater, **patr- ‘father’**.
**Etymology**

Meaning "one who advances the cause" (of an artist, institution, etc.), usually by the person's wealth and power, is attested from late 14c.; "commonly a wretch who supports with insolence, and is paid with flattery" [Johnson]. Commercial sense of "regular customer" first recorded c. 1600. Patron saint (1717) originally was simply patron (late 14c.).
