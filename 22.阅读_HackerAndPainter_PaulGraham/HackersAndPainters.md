   **Etymology**

   **redundant** (adj.)

   1590s, from Latin redundantem (nominative redundans), present participle of redundare, literally "overflow, pour over; be over-full;" figuratively "be in excess," from re- "again" (see [re-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/re-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + undare"rise in waves," from unda "a wave," from PIE *unda-, nasalized form of root [*wed-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*wed-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (1) "water; wet." Of persons, in employment situations, from 1928, chiefly British. Related: Redundantly. 

   **redundant:** [17] Etymologically, something that is *redundant* ‘overflows’ because there is too much of it. The word comes from the present participle of Latin *redundāre* ‘flow back, overflow’ (source also of English *redound* [14]). This was a compound verb formed from the prefix *re*- ‘back, again’ and *undāre* ‘rise in waves, surge’, a derivative of *unda* ‘wave’ (source of English *undulate*). => [redound](http://www.youdict.com/etym/s/redound), [surround](http://www.youdict.com/etym/s/surround), [undulate](http://www.youdict.com/etym/s/undulate)

   **laundry** (n.)
   late 14c., "place for washing;" mid-15c., "act of washing," a contraction (compare launder) of Middle English lavendrie (late 13c.), from Old French lavanderie "wash-house," from Vulgar Latin lavandaria "things to be washed," plural of lavandarium, from lavare "to wash" (from PIE root *leue- "to wash"). English meaning "articles that need to be or have been laundered" is from 1916. As a verb, from 1880. Laundry list in figurative sense is from 1958.

   **laundry:** [16] Although it is better disguised than most of its relatives, *laundry* is one of a large family of English words derived from Latin *lavāre* ‘wash’ (see LAVATORY). It is a contraction of an earlier *lavendry*, which came via Old French *lavanderie* from Latin *lavandārium* ‘things to be washed’. By the time it reached English it had also acquired the meaning ‘place where things are washed’.

1. 助记：

   来自 PIE * wegh, 移动，运送，词源同 way,wag. 引申词义摆动，扭动。

2. 词源：

   wiggle (v.)
   early 13c., perhaps from Middle Dutch, Middle Low German, or Middle Flemish wigelen, frequentative of wiegen "to rock, wag, move back and forth," from wiege "cradle," from Proto-Germanic *wig- (source also of Old High German wiga, German Wiege "cradle," Old Frisian widze), from PIE root *wegh- "to go, move, transport in a vehicle." Related: Wiggled; wiggling. The noun is attested from 1816.

   *wegh-

   Proto-Indo-European root meaning "to go, move, transport in a vehicle."

   > The root wegh-, "to convey, especially by wheeled vehicle," is found in virtually every branch of Indo-European, including now Anatolian. The root, as well as other widely represented roots such as aks- and nobh-, attests to the presence of the wheel -- and vehicles using it -- at the time Proto-Indo-European was spoken.
