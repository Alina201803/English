   Early 17th century: from modern Latin logarithmus, from Greek logos ‘reckoning, ratio’ + arithmos ‘number’.

   **Etymology**

    *logarithm (n.)*

   class of arithmetical functions used to shorten calculation, 1610s, logarithmus, coined in Modern Latin by Scottish mathematician John Napier (1550-1617), literally "ratio-number," from Greek logos"proportion, ratio, word" (see [Logos](https://www.etymonline.com/word/Logos?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + arithmos "number" (from PIE *erei-dhmo-, suffixed variant form of root [*re-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*re-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to reason, count").

They also allow a geometric relationship to be represented conveniently by a straight line. The base of a common logarithm is 10, and that of a natural logarithm is the number e (2.71828 …)

1. 助记,

2. 词源

   **Origin**

   Middle English: from Old French or Latin, from Greek ēkhō, related to ēkhē ‘a sound’.

    **echo (n.)**

   mid-14c., "**sound repeated by reflection**," from Latin **echo,** from Greek echo, personified in classical mythology as a mountain nymph who pined away for love of Narcissus until nothing was left of her but her voice, from or related to ekhe "sound," ekhein "to resound," from PIE *wagh-io-, extended form of root *(s)wagh- "to resound" (source also of Sanskrit vagnuh "sound," Latin vagire "to cry," Old English swogan "to resound"). Related: Echoes. Echo chamber attested from 1937.

   **echo** 借自拉丁语，但源出希腊神话传说。在古希腊神话中 **Echo** 是居于山林水泽的仙女。据古罗马诗人奥维德( **Ovid** ，43 **BC **—17 **AD** )的长诗《变形记》， **Echo** 曾做过天后赫拉( **Hera** )的使女。当赫拉的丈夫主神宙斯( **Zeus** )和情人幽会时， **Echo**故意缠住好妒的赫拉，不停地同她讲话，转移她的注意力，使她不能继续监视丈夫。后来赫拉发现上当，又气又恨，就使 **Echo** 失去独立说话的能力，而只能重复别人谈话的尾音。之后，可怜的 **Echo** 在林中遇见了美少年那喀索斯( **Narcissus** )，爱上了他，但遭到了拒绝。从此终日抑郁，形容日见枯槁，以至最后在山林中只留下她叹息的声音。现在每当我们在山间高喊，就能听到回声，仿佛是 **Echo** 在应答似的。另据希腊作家朗戈斯（ **Longus** ，创作时期2 **-** 3世纪）的说法， **Echo** 拒绝了畜牧神潘( **Pan** )的求爱，潘怀恨在心，使一群牧人发疯，把她撕成碎片。大地女神盖亚( **Gaea** )掩埋了她的尸体，只让她的回声留在人间。因此， **Echo **一词进入了英语之后，就被赋予了“回声”、“反响”等义。

Perhaps from PIE pronominal stem *i- [Watkins]; but Klein, OED suggest it probably originally from an oblique case of a noun meaning "doubt" (compare Old High German iba "condition, stipulation, doubt," Old Norse if "doubt, hesitation," Swedish jäf "exception, challenge"). As a noun from 1510s.

   *i*

   Old English geon "that (over there)," from Proto-Germanic *jaino- (source also of Old Frisian jen, Old Norse enn, Old High German ener, Middle Dutch ghens, German jener, Gothic jains "that, you"), from PIE pronominal stem *i- (source also of Sanskrit ena-, third person pronoun, anena "that;" Latin idem"the same," id "it, that one;" Old Church Slavonic onu "he;" Lithuanian ans "he"). As an adverb from late 15c., a shortening of [yonder](https://www.etymonline.com/word/yonder?ref=etymonline_crossreference).

   1) 路由器 a piece of electronic equipment that connectscomputer networks to each other, and sends information betweennetworks 

   A device which forwards data packets to the appropriate parts of a computer network.

   A **router**[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)#cite_note-2) is a [networking device](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_device) that forwards [data packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_packet) between [computer networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the [Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet). A data packet is typically [forwarded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_forwarding) from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an [internetwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internetwork) until it reaches its destination [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking)).[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)#cite_note-3)

   A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks.[[b\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)#cite_note-4) When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the [network address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address) information in the packet to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its [routing table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_table) or [routing policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routing_policy), it directs the packet to the next network on its journey.

   The most familiar type of routers are [home and small office routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_router) that simply forward [IP packets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_packet) between the home computers and the Internet. An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which connects to the Internet through an [Internet service provider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider) (ISP). More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful [core routers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_router) that forward data at high speed along the [optical fiber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber) lines of the [Internet backbone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone). Though routers are typically **dedicated** hardware devices, software-based routers also exist.

2. 词源,

   **Origin**

   Mid 16th century (as a stage direction): from Latin exit ‘he or she goes out’, third person singular present tense of exire, from **ex- ‘out’ + ire ‘go’.** The noun (late 16th century) is from Latin exitus ‘going out’, from the verb exire, and the other verb uses (early 17th century) derive from it.

Meaning "a way of departure" is from 1690s; specific meaning "door for leaving" is from 1786. The verb is c. 1600, from the noun; it ought to be left to stage directions and the clunky jargon of police reports.

   *culprit (n.)*

   1670s, from Anglo-French cul prit, contraction of Culpable: prest (d'averrer nostre bille) "guilty, ready (to prove our case)," words used by prosecutor in opening a trial. It seems the abbreviation cul. prit was mistaken in English for an address to the defendant.

   **Origin**

   Middle English: from Old French devis, based on Latin divis- ‘divided’, from the verb dividere. The original sense was ‘desire or intention’, found now only in leave someone to their own devices (which has become associated with device (sense 2)).

   **Etymology**

   c. 1300, "intent, desire; an expressed intent or desire; a plan or design; a literary composition," from Old French devis "division, separation; disposition, wish, desire; coat of arms, emblem; a bequest in a will, act of bequeathing," from deviser "arrange, plan, contrive," literally "dispose in portions," from Vulgar Latin *divisare, frequentative of Latin dividere "to divide" (see [divide](https://www.etymonline.com/word/divide?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (v.)).

   The oldest sense is "method by which something is divided," which arose in Old French and led to the range of modern meanings. In English, from c. 1400 as "artistic design, work of art; ornament;" also "mechanical device," such as a large crossbow fitted with a crank. Also from late 14c. as "a disguise; a fashion in dress; a scheme, stratagem, an intrigue; boundary, division."

**pandemonium**

1. 定义

n.一片混乱；闹哄哄的场所

1. 词源

667, Pandæmonium, in "Paradise Lost" the name of the palace built in the middle of Hell, "the high capital of Satan and all his peers," coined by John Milton (1608-1674) from Greek pan- "all" (see [pan-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/pan-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + Late Latin daemonium "evil spirit," from Greek daimonion "inferior divine power," from daimon "lesser god" (see [demon](https://www.etymonline.com/word/demon?ref=etymonline_crossreference)).

Transferred sense "place of uproar" is from 1779; that of "wild, lawless confusion" is from 1865. Related: Pandemoniac; pandemoniacal; pandemonian; pandemonic.

1. 相关词

demon (n.)

c. 1200, from Latin daemon "spirit," from Greek daimon "deity, divine power; lesser god; guiding spirit, tutelary deity" (sometimes including souls of the dead); "one's genius, lot, or fortune;" from PIE *dai-mon- "divider, provider" (of fortunes or destinies), from root [*da-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*da-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to divide."Used (with daimonion) in Christian Greek translations and Vulgate for "god of the heathen" and "unclean spirit." Jewish authors earlier had employed the Greek word in this sense, using it to render shedim "lords, idols" in the Septuagint, and Matthew viii.31 has daimones, translated as deofol in Old English, feend or deuil in Middle English. Another Old English word for this was hellcniht, literally "hell-knight."The original mythological sense is sometimes written daemon for purposes of distinction. The Demon of Socrates was a daimonion, a "divine principle or inward oracle." His accusers, and later the Church Fathers, however, represented this otherwise.

"collation, comparison, discussion" (also "a light supper"), from Latin collationem (nominative collatio) "a bringing together, collection, comparison," noun of action from collatus, irregular past participle of conferre "to bring together" (see [collate](https://www.etymonline.com/word/collate?ref=etymonline_crossreference)).The word has had many meanings over the centuries in theology and law. It was the title of a popular 5c. religious work by John Cassian (sometimes translated into Old English as Þurhtogenes), hence the word's general sense "a compilation of lives of the Church fathers." The "light supper" sense is from the meal taken by members of a monastery at the end of the day after hearing readings from the Collation.

   **Etymology**

   first person singular present **indicative of [be](https://www.etymonline.com/word/be?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (q.v.);** Old English eom bMercian eam, Northumbrian am), from Proto-Germanic *izm(i)-, from PIE *esmi- (source also of Old Norse emi, Gothic im, Hittite esmi, Old Church Slavonic jesmi, Lithuanian esmi), first person singular form of root [*es-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*es-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to be."In Old English it formed only present tenses, all other forms being expressed in the W-BASE (see [were](https://www.etymonline.com/word/were?ref=etymonline_crossreference), [was](https://www.etymonline.com/word/was?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). This cooperative verb is sometimes referred to by linguists as *es-*wes-. Until the distinction broke down 13c., *es-*wes- tended to express "existence," with beon meaning something closer to "come to be."Old English am had two plural forms: 1. sind/sindon, sie and 2. earon/aron. The s- form (also used in the subjunctive) fell from English in the early 13c. (though its cousin continues in German sind, the 3rd person plural of "to be") and was replaced by forms of be, but aron (see [are](https://www.etymonline.com/word/are?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) continued, and as am and be merged it encroached on some uses that previously had belonged to be. By the early 1500s it had established its place in standard English.

"Plumbing" is generally used to describe the conveyance of water, gas, or liquid waste in domestic or commercial environments; "piping" is often used to describe the high-performance (high-pressure, high-flow, high-temperature or hazardous-material) conveyance of fluids in specialized applications. "Tubing" is sometimes used for lighter-weight piping, especially that flexible enough to be supplied in coiled form.

   Fittings (especially uncommon types) require money, time, materials and tools to install, and are an important part of [piping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piping) and [plumbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing) systems.[[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piping_and_plumbing_fitting#cite_note-1) [Valves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valve) are technically fittings, but are usually discussed separately.

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Middle English: from Old Frech compas (noun), compasser (verb), based on Latin com- ‘together’ + passus ‘a step or pace’. Several senses (‘measure’, ‘artifice’, ‘circumscribed area’, and ‘pair of compasses’) which appeared in Middle English are also found in Old French, but their development and origin are uncertain. The transference of sense to the magnetic compass is held to have occurred in the related Italian word compasso, from the circular shape of the compass box.

   **Etymology**

   c. 1300, "space, area, extent, circumference," from Old French compas "circle, radius; size, extent; pair of compasses" (12c.), from compasser "to go around, measure (with a compass); divide equally," from Vulgar Latin *compassare "to pace out," from Latin com "with, together" (see [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + passus "a step" (from PIE root [*pete-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*pete-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to spread").The mathematical instrument for describing circles was so called in English from mid-14c. The mariners' directional tool (so called since early 15c.) took the name, perhaps, because it's round and has a point like the mathematical instrument.Meaning "limits, boundary" is from 1550s. Sense of "range of notes which a given voice or instrument can produce" is from 1590s. The word is in most European languages, with a mathematical sense in Romance, a nautical sense in Germanic, and both in English. In Middle English it also could mean "ingenuity, subtlety, cunning." Also an adverb in Middle English: to go compass was "go in a circle, go around."

   [Parameter - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter)

   **Computer programming**

   In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), two notions of [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)) are commonly used, and are referred to as [parameters and arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments)—or more formally as a **formal parameter** and an **actual parameter**.

   For example, in the definition of a function such as

   `y = f(x) = x + 2,`


   *x* is the *formal parameter* (the *parameter*) of the defined function.

   When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in

   `f(3): or, y = f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,`


    is the *actual parameter* (the *argument*) for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the *formal parameter* of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms *parameter* and *argument* might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)

   These concepts are discussed in a more precise way in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and its foundational disciplines, [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) and [combinatory logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic). Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) define parameter and argument as given here, while [Eiffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)) uses an [alternative convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Alternative_convention_in_Eiffel).

   In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.

   > [Parameter (computer programming) - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments)
   >
   > Parameters appear in procedure definitions; arguments appear in procedure calls. In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. **Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.**

    **Mathematical functions[[edit source](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=1)]**

   [Mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_function) have one or more [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function) that are designated in the definition by [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)). A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general [quadratic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function) by declaring


   here, the variable *x* designates the function's argument, but *a*, *b*, and *c* are parameters that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-*b* logarithm by the formula

3. 释义,

      限定因素 a set of facts or a fixed limit that establishes or limits how something can or musthappen or be done

      Technical A numerical or other measurable factor forming one of a set that defines a system or sets the conditions of its operation.   ‘there are three parameters by which a speaker is able to modify the meaning of the utterance—pitch, volume, and tempo’
