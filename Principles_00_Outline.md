#### **Abyss** UK /əˈbɪs/ US /əˈbɪs/

1. 助记,

   “a-”+“byss”  byss是base是元音通转

   **a-**：前缀，表示“没有”，同‘not,without’。

   **byss**： 来源于拉丁语byssus，表示“底，底下”，同'base,bottom,depth’。

   **abyss**：关押反叛天使的无底地狱
   英语单词abyss源自希腊语abyssos，由否定前缀a-和byssos（底，bottom）组成，意为“无底洞”。
   根据基督教的教义，上帝带圣子基督巡游天界，让众天使向圣子下跪参拜。天界中地位最高的天使长路西法Lucifer拒绝向人类出身的圣子基督臣服，率领三分之一的天使造反。经过三天的激战，圣子基督战胜反叛天使，将其打入永劫的无底洞abyss。除路西法外，所有反叛天使都被除名，蜕变为丑恶形象，只有路西法依然保持六翼天使的光辉形象。被打入无底洞的路西法就是后来的撒旦。
   按照但丁在《神曲》中的描写，abyss位于地狱（inferno）的最底层，是关押恶魔和反叛天使的地方。在佛教中，八大地狱中的第八个地狱叫做“阿鼻地狱”，“阿鼻”的意思是“无间”，表示在该地狱中要承受永恒的痛苦，从不间断。abyss的发音与“阿鼻”很接近，一个表示基督教中的“无底地狱”，一个表示佛教中的“无间地狱”。

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Late Middle English (in the sense ‘infernal pit’): via late Latin from Greek abussos ‘bottomless’, from a- ‘without’ + bussos ‘depth’.

   **Etymology**

   late 14c. in Latin form abyssus, "depths of the earth or sea; primordial chaos;" early 14c. as abime "depths of the earth or sea; bottomless pit, Hell" (from Old French; see [abysm](https://www.etymonline.com/word/abysm?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Both are from Late Latin abyssus "bottomless pit," from Greek abyssos (limne) "bottomless (pool)," from abyssos "bottomless, unfathomed," hence, generally, "enormous, unfathomable," also as a noun, he abyssos "the great depth, the underworld, the bottomless pit." This is a compound of a- "without" (see [a-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/a-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (3)) + byssos "bottom," a word of uncertain origin possibly related to bathos "depth" [Liddell & Scott]. Watkins suggests a connection with the root of bottom (n.); Beekes suggests it is pre-Greek.

3. 释义,

   n. 1)深渊，无底洞，与‘sbysm’同义(hole)**a very deep hole that seems to have no bottom**

   ​    2)坏情况，险恶的境地(bad situation)**a difficult situation that brings trouble or destruction**

#### **Principle**

1. 助记,

   principle = prin(prime) + cip(capture)  首要需抓住的是原则

   from primus "first" (see [prime](https://www.etymonline.com/word/prime?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (adj.)) + root of capere "to take," from PIE root [*kap-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*kap-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to grasp."

   英语单词prince来自拉丁语princeps，principle由prince/primus（first，与prime同源）+ capere（to take，拿）构成，字面意思就是“the one who takes the first (place/position)”（首席，排在第一位的人）。
   在古罗马共和国时期，罗马元老院中的威望和权力最大的议员就被称为princeps senatus（首席议员）。

   罗马帝国的第一个皇帝、凯撒大帝的继承人屋大维上台后，从凯撒遇刺事件中看到了罗马贵族对独裁统治的普遍反感，没有采用dictator（独裁官）或rex（king，国王）的头衔，而是借鉴“首席议员”（princeps senatus）这个称谓，选用了一个比较谦逊的头衔Princeps，通常译为“第一公民”或“元首”。从此以后，罗马帝国的最高首脑除了emperor（皇帝）头衔外，还都担任Princeps职务，

   英语单词prince（国君、王子）就来自Princeps。由此可见，在西方人的传统观念中，一国之君不过是“首席”、“第一公民”而已，绝不像咱中国一样被看成是“天子”。


2. 词源,

    **OED Origin**

   Late Middle English: from Old French, from Latin principium ‘source’, principia (plural) ‘foundations’, from princeps, princip- ‘first, chief’.

Used absolutely for (good or moral) principle from 1650s.It is often easier to fight for principles than to live up to them. [Adlai Stevenson, speech, New York City, Aug. 27, 1952]Scientific sense of "general law of nature" is recorded from 1802. The English -l- apparently is by analogy of participle, etc.

3. 释义,

#### **Adventure** US /ædˈvɛntʃɚ/

 `my call to adventure`

1. 助记,

   “ad-”+“ven”+“-ture”

   **ad-**：前缀，表示“朝，向，去”，。

   **ven/vent**： 来源于拉丁语venire，表示“来”，‘come’。字面义“来临”，冒险途中会有很多意想不到的事件来临，引申为“冒险”。

   **-ture**： 表名词，通常在单词或词根以t结尾时使用，表示“一般状态，行为，结果”，‘the result’。

   adventure → “the result of a coming to somebody来到某人身上的事情”

   advent(到来)：基督的两次降临

   根据基督教的教义，耶稣基督一共两次降临世界：第一次是诞生之时，以自己的生命为人类赎罪；第二次是在世界末日来临之前，他将再度降临世界。为了纪念耶稣基督的降临，在圣诞节前四个星期，从第一个周日到圣诞夜，基督教徒将这段时间称为“耶稣降临节”（Advent），用于筹备庆祝耶稣的降临。英语单词advent在基督教中有特殊含义，表示“耶稣的降临”。它来自拉丁语adventus，由ad（to）+venire（come）组合演变而成。后来，该词逐渐应用与其他领域，用来表示不同寻常的人或事物的来临或发生。英语单词adventure（冒险）与此同源，来自拉丁语adventurus，是adventus的未来式，本意是“即将发生的事情，运气”，现在一般表示“冒险、投机”。

   >  @豆腐块 ,adventure,冒险,是往外出发, 我觉得选择 'vent' 的含义为 go比较好. vent 可以理解为go的过去式 went. from a suffixed form of PIE root [*gwa-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*gwa-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to go, come."
   >
   >  adventure = ad(to) + vent(went) + ure, 出发去冒险.

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Middle English: from Old French aventure (noun), aventurer (verb), based on Latin adventurus ‘about to happen’, from advenire ‘arrive’.

   **Etymology**

   c. 1200, aventure, auenture "that which happens by chance, fortune, luck," from Old French aventure (11c.) "chance, accident, occurrence, event, happening," from Latin adventura (res) "(a thing) about to happen," from fem. of adventurus, future participle of advenire "to come to, reach, arrive at," from ad "to" (see [ad-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/ad-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + venire "to come," from a suffixed form of PIE root [*gwa-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*gwa-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to go, come."

#### **Threshold** /ˈθreʃ.hoʊld/

1. 助记,

   门槛引申为起点，界限

   >  @豆腐块, Thread是是线, hold是拿, 扯一根线, 作为门槛.

2. 词源.

   **OED Origin**

   Old English therscold, threscold; related to German dialect Drischaufel; the first element is related to thresh (in a Germanic sense ‘tread’), but the origin of the second element is unknown.

   **Etymology**

   Old English þrescold, þærscwold, þerxold, etc., "door-sill, point of entering," of uncertain origin and probably much altered by folk-etymology. The first element probably is related to Old English þrescan (see thresh), either in its current sense of "thresh" or with its original sense of "tread, trample." Second element has been much transformed in all the Germanic languages, suggesting its literal sense was lost even in ancient times. In English it probably has been altered to conform to hold. Liberman (Oxford University Press blog, Feb. 11, 2015) revives an old theory that the second element is the Proto-Germanic instrumental suffix *-thlo and the original sense of threshold was a threshing area adjacent to the living area of a house. Cognates include Old Norse þreskjoldr, Swedish tröskel, Old High German driscufli, German dialectal drischaufel. Figurative use was in Old English.

3. 释义.

2. 词源.

   OED

   Late Middle English (in the sense ‘infernal pit’): via late Latin from Greek abussos ‘bottomless’, from a- ‘without’ + bussos ‘depth’.

   ETYMON.

   late 14c. in Latin form abyssus, "depths of the earth or sea; primordial chaos;" early 14c. as abime "depths of the earth or sea; bottomless pit, Hell" (from Old French; see [abysm](https://www.etymonline.com/word/abysm?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Both are from Late Latin abyssus "bottomless pit," from Greek abyssos (limne) "bottomless (pool)," from abyssos "bottomless, unfathomed," hence, generally, "enormous, unfathomable," also as a noun, he abyssos "the great depth, the underworld, the bottomless pit." This is a compound of a- "without" (see [a-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/a-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (3)) + byssos "bottom," a word of uncertain origin possibly related to bathos "depth" [Liddell & Scott]. Watkins suggests a connection with the root of bottom (n.); Beekes suggests it is pre-Greek.

   The current form in English is a 16c. partial re-Latinization. Greek abyssos was used in Septuagint to translate Hebrew tehom "original chaos" and was used in the New Testament for "Hell." OED notes, "the word has had five variants, abime, abysm, abysmus, abyssus, abyss; of which abyss remains as the ordinary form, and abysm as archaic or poetic." In reference to a seemingly bottomless gulf from 1630s.

[Margery Williams, "The Velveteen Rabbit"]Real estate, the exact term, is first recorded 1660s, but in Middle English real was used in law in reference to immovable property, paired with, and distinguished from, personal. Noun phrase real time is early 19c. as a term in logic and philosophy, 1953 as an adjectival phrase; get real, usually an interjection, was U.S. college slang in 1960s, reached wide popularity c. 1987.

   Old English dælan "to divide, distribute, separate, share, bestow, dispense," from the source of [deal](https://www.etymonline.com/word/deal?ref=etymonline_crossreference)(n.). Meaning "to distribute cards before a game" is from 1520s. **To deal with "handle" is attested from mid-15c. Related: Dealt; dealing.**

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Late Middle English (in the senses ‘forming the root’ and ‘inherent’): from late Latin radicalis, from Latin radix, radic- ‘root’.

3. 释义,

   1)根本的,  (especially of change or action) relating to or affecting the fundamental nature of something; far-reaching or thorough.

   ​

#### **Understand**

1. 助记,(略)

   under + stand 取比喻义, 站到一个观点的下面,就是理解和明白.

2. 词源,

   Old English understandan "comprehend, grasp the idea of," probably literally "stand in the midst of," from [under](https://www.etymonline.com/word/under?ref=etymonline_crossreference) + standan "to stand" (see [stand](https://www.etymonline.com/word/stand?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (v.)). If this is the meaning, the under is not the usual word meaning "beneath," but from Old English under, from PIE *nter- "between, among" (source also of Sanskrit antar "among, between," Latin inter "between, among," Greek entera "intestines;" see [inter-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/inter-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Related: Understood; [understanding](https://www.etymonline.com/word/understanding?ref=etymonline_crossreference).

   That is the suggestion in Barnhart, but other sources regard the "among, between, before, in the presence of" sense of Old English prefix and preposition under as other meanings of the same word. "Among" seems to be the sense in many Old English compounds that resemble understand, such as underniman "to receive," undersecan "examine, investigate, scrutinize" (literally "underseek"), underðencan "consider, change one's mind," underginnan "to begin." It also seems to be the sense still in expressions such as under such circumstances.

   Perhaps the ultimate sense is "be close to;" compare Greek epistamai "I know how, I know," literally "I stand upon." Similar formations are found in Old Frisian (understonda), Middle Danish (understande), while other Germanic languages use compounds meaning "stand before" (German verstehen, represented in Old English by forstanden "understand," also "oppose, withstand"). **For this concept, most Indo-European languages use figurative extensions of compounds that literally mean "put together," or "separate," or "take, grasp" (see [comprehend](https://www.etymonline.com/word/comprehend?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Old** English oferstandan, Middle English overstonden, literally "over-stand" seem to have been used only in literal senses. For "to stand under" in a physical sense, Old English had undergestandan.

3. 释义, (略)

#### **Wire** 接线

1. 助记,

   People are wired differently,
   这里取的是比喻义, 人的大脑结构是不一样的, (不同的接线方式)
   早期的电脑是通过插线编程,让电脑执行任务,不同的插线方式执行的命令.
   这里比喻每个人大脑的插线连接方式是不同的.
   The brain are wired(比喻 figuratively)

   The word 'wired' is figuratively used here. So, if you have differently wired brain, you mean to say that you are 'different' than others.

#### Cultivate  [ˈkʌltɪveɪt]

1. 助记：cul=till "耕种,培养" + -ate“表动词”

   cultivate 与 culture 同源。在英语中，Culture是“文化”，civilization，是“文明”。
   有时候它们可以混用，人们往往分不清它们之间的差异其实很简单，在考古学上，出现了城市的就是civilization，没有出现城市的就是culture。表示文明的civilization的词根是civil（市民的、城市的）。历史学家认为，人类修建城市，开始城市生活后才是人类文明的开始。在这之前，人们还属于农业社会，所进行的活动就是culture，字面意思就是耕种、培育，也就是农业活动。

   **OED Origin**

   Old English heofon, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch hemel and German Himmel.
   **Etymology**

   Old English heofon "home of God," earlier "the visible sky, firmament," probably from Proto-Germanic*hibin-, dissimilated from *himin- (cognates Low German heben, Old Norse himinn, Gothic himins, Old Frisian himul, Dutch hemel, **German Himmel "heaven, sky"),** which is of uncertain origin. Perhaps literally "a covering," from a PIE root *kem- "to cover" (also proposed as the source of [chemise](https://www.etymonline.com/word/chemise?ref=etymonline_crossreference)). Watkins derives it elaborately from PIE *ak- "sharp" via *akman- "stone, sharp stone," then "stony vault of heaven."
