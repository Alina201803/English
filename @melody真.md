**Casino**
这是中文里蹦出的单词。相传是马可波罗发明的，当年马可波罗在他的马可波罗行纪里面描写元大都的那种盛况的时候，那时候人们喜欢玩一种游戏，那种游戏就是把一个骰子放在碗里面开始摇，开盖的那一瞬间他们就会说“开骰”了，马可波罗听到这个音觉得像casino，于是就把赌博的游戏就演变成了今天的赌场。

Introduction

blizzard n.

释义:

1. a severe snow storm with strong winds暴风雪；雪暴
2. a large amount of something that arrives or is produced together in aconfusing or badly organized way大量繁乱的事（物）

词源:

1.选自牛津词典词源

Early 19th century (originally US, denoting a violent blow): of unknown origin.

2.选自etymonline

"strong, sustained storm of wind and cold, and dry, driving snow," 1859, origin obscure (perhaps somehow connected with [blaze](https://www.etymonline.com/word/blaze?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.1), and compare [blazer](https://www.etymonline.com/word/blazer?ref=etymonline_crossreference)); it came into general use in the U.S. in this sense in the hard winter of 1880-81. OED says it probably is "more or less onomatopœic," and adds "there is nothing to indicate a French origin." Before that it typically meant "a violent blow," also "hail of gunfire" in American English from 1829, and blizz "violent rainstorm" is attested from 1770. The winter storm sense perhaps is originally a colloquial figurative use in the Upper Midwest of the U.S.
