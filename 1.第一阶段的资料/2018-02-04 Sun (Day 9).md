**OED Origin**
Early 17th century: from Latin negotiat- ‘done in the course of business’, from the verb negotiari, from negotium ‘business’, from neg- ‘not’ + otium ‘leisure’.
**Etymology**
"to communicate in search of mutual agreement," 1590s, back-formation from negotiation, or else from Latin negotiatus, past participle of negotiari "carry on business, do business," from **negotium** "a business, employment, occupation, affair (public or private)," literally **"lack of leisure,"** from neg- "not" (from PIE root *ne- "not") + otium "ease, leisure."
In the sense of "tackle successfully" (1862), it at first meant "to clear on horseback a hedge, fence, or other obstacle" and "originated in the hunting-field; those who hunt the fox like also to hunt jocular verbal novelties" [Gowers, 1965]. Related: Negotiated; negotiating.

1. 词源,
Foundation, 
 literally "a placing under,"
 from hypo- "under" (see hypo-) + thesis "a placing, proposition" (from reduplicated form of PIE root *dhe- "to set, put").  
引申为,  "basis of an argument, “
**OED Origin**
Late 16th century: via late Latin from Greek hupothesis ‘foundation’, from hupo ‘under’ + thesis ‘placing’.
**Etymology**
1590s, "a particular statement;" 1650s, "a proposition, assumed and taken for granted, used as a premise," from Middle French hypothese and directly from Late Latin hypothesis, from Greek hypothesis **"base, groundwork, foundation,"** hence in extended use "basis of an argument, supposition," literally "a placing under," from hypo- "under" (see hypo-) + thesis "a placing, proposition" (from reduplicated form of PIE root *dhe- "to set, put"). A term in logic; narrower scientific sense is from 1640s.
2. 助记, 
hypo- "under"  + thesis(place) 
科学研究法,即是先假设,在假设的基础上进行逻辑推导,提出预测,求证后,对假设的前提进行修改.因此,假设是思考的基础,是地基 Foundation, base, groundwork, foundation

这个单词的困难之处是,找不到h开头的under的单词.而h则关联到了high
可以先暂时关联到`hide`, 正如'假设’这个翻译,隐藏了’foundation’的本意一样,
暂且理解为,地基,藏在地下的部分.

declare (v.)表明，声明，宣告，宣布
declaration (n.)声明，宣言，宣布
clarify (v.)讲清楚，阐明，澄清
clarification (n.)阐明，澄清
clarity (n.) 清澈，透明的

**Declare** /dɪˈkleər/

De- ‘thoroughly’ + clarare ‘make clear’
词根de的含义为down,这一引申为"down to the bottom, totally" hence "completely”, 一脱到底的彻底
一脱到底展示出来,declare oneself,示爱

**OED Origin**
Middle English: from Latin declarare, from de- ‘thoroughly’ + clarare ‘make clear’ (from clarus ‘clear’).
**Etymology**
early 14c., from Old French declarer "explain, elucidate," or directly from Latin declarare "make clear, reveal, disclose, announce," from de- intensive prefix (see de-) + clarare "clarify," from clarus "clear" (see clear (adj.)). Related: Declared; declaring.
> **de-**  
> active word-forming element in English and in many words inherited from French and Latin, from Latin de "down, down from, from, off; concerning" (see de), also used as a prefix in Latin usually meaning "down, off, away, from among, down from," but also "down to the bottom, totally" hence "completely" (intensive or completive), which is its sense in many English words. As a Latin prefix it also had the function of undoing or reversing a verb's action, and hence it came to be used as a pure privative -- "not, do the opposite of, undo" -- which is its primary function as a living prefix in English, as in defrost (1895), defuse (1943), etc. Compare also dis-.
