> 若入射的是均匀介质，那么光只会发生发射折射，如果是不均匀介质就会发射散射，更本质的原因是，光线照射到粒子时，如果粒子大于入射光波长很多倍，则发生光的反射；如果粒子小于入射光波长，则发生光的散射，即微观衍射，这时观察到的是光波环绕微粒而向其四周放射的光。

Ghost /ɡoʊst/
1. 助记
可以这样记忆：g(中文“鬼”)+host(n.主人；v.做主人，做东道主)
2. 词源
对比ghost和spirit
Ghost源自古英语的’呼吸’gāst (in the sense ‘spirit, soul’)
Spirit源自古拉丁语的’呼吸’ (spire)

摘自牛津词典 Origin
Old English gāst (in the sense ‘spirit, soul’), of Germanic origin; related to Dutch geest and German Geist. The gh- spelling occurs first in Caxton, probably influenced by Flemish gheest.
**Etymology**
Old English gast "breath; good or bad spirit, angel, demon; person, man, human being," in Biblical use "soul, spirit, life," from Proto-Germanic *gaistaz (source also of Old Saxon gest, Old Frisian jest, Middle Dutch gheest, Dutch geest, German Geist "spirit, ghost"). This is conjectured to be from a PIE root *gheis-, used in forming words involving the notions of excitement, amazement, or fear (source also of Sanskrit hedah "wrath;" Avestan zaesha- "horrible, frightful;" Gothic usgaisjan, Old English gæstan "to frighten").
	Ghost is the English representative of the usual West Germanic word for "supernatural being." In Christian writing in Old English it is used to render Latin spiritus (see spirit (n.)), a sense preserved in Holy Ghost. Sense of "disembodied spirit of a dead person," especially imagined as wandering among the living or haunting them, is attested from late 14c. and returns the word toward its likely prehistoric sense.
3. 释义
n. ①鬼，幽灵(Spirit)the spirit of a dead person, sometimes represented as a pale, almost transparent image of that person that some people believe appears to people who are alive；
同义词, phantom /ˈfæn.t̬əm/

vt. 悄悄地行进；

**Murder**
1. 助记, 
murder = mor + der (mor,从to die,引申到harm,bite, to rub away)
2. 词源,
Old English morthor, of Germanic origin, **PIE root *mer- "to rub away, harm"
**OED Origin**
Old English morthor, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch moord and German Mord, from an Indo-European root shared by Sanskrit mará ‘death’ and Latin mors; reinforced in Middle English by Old French murdre.
**Etymology**
c. 1300, murdre, from Old English **morðor** (plural morþras) "secret killing of a person, unlawful killing," also "mortal sin, crime; punishment, torment, misery," from Proto-Germanic *murthra- (source also of Goth maurþr, and, from a variant form of the same root, Old Saxon morth, Old Frisian morth, Old Norse morð, Middle Dutch moort, Dutch moord, German Mord "murder"), from suffixed form of **PIE root *mer- "to rub away, harm"** (also "to die" and forming words referring to death and to beings subject to death). The spelling with -d- probably reflects influence of Anglo-French murdre, from Old French mordre, from Medieval Latin murdrum, from the Germanic root.
> Viking custom, typical of Germanic, distinguished morð (Old Norse) "secret slaughter," from vig (Old Norse) "slaying." The former involved concealment, or slaying a man by night or when asleep, and was a heinous crime. The latter was not a disgrace, if the killer acknowledged his deed, but he was subject to vengeance or demand for compensation.

2. 词源
From Latin remordere ‘vex’, from re- (expressing intensive force) + mordere ‘to bite’.
**OED Origin**
Late Middle English: from Old French remors, from medieval Latin remorsus, from Latin remordere ‘vex’, from re- (expressing intensive force) + mordere ‘to bite’.
**Etymology**
late 14c., from Old French remors (Modern French remords), from Medieval Latin remorsum, noun use of neuter past participle of Latin remordere "to vex, disturb," literally "to bite back," from re- "back" (see re-) + mordere "to bite," which is perhaps from an extended form of PIE root *mer- "to rub away, harm."
	The sense evolution was via the Medieval Latin phrase remorsus conscientiæ (translated into Middle English as ayenbite of inwit). Middle English also had a verb, remord "to strike with remorse, touch with compassion, prick one's conscience."

3. 释义,
​1)  懊悔；悔恨；自责, a feeling of sadness and being sorry for something you have done
Deep regret or guilt for a wrong committed.

 ay through the nose (1670s) seems to suggest "bleed." Many extended meanings are from the horse-racing sense of "length of a horse's nose," as a measure of distance between two finishers (1908). To turn up one's nose "show disdain" is from 1818 (earlier hold up one's nose, 1570s); similar notion in look down one's nose (1921). To say something is under (one's) nose "in plain view" is from 1540s.

**OED  Origin**
**Old English tunge**, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch tong, German Zunge, and Latin lingua.
**Etymology**
Old English tunge "**tongue, organ of speech; speech, a people's language**," from Proto-Germanic *tungon (source also of Old Saxon and Old Norse tunga, Old Frisian tunge, Middle Dutch tonghe, Dutch tong, Old High German zunga, German Zunge, Gothic tuggo), from PIE root [*dnghu-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*dnghu-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)"tongue."
	For substitution of -o- for -u-, see [come](https://www.etymonline.com/word/come?ref=etymonline_crossreference). The spelling of the ending of the word apparently is a 14c. attempt to indicate proper pronunciation, but the result is "neither etymological nor phonetic, and is only in a very small degree historical" [OED]. In the "knowledge of a foreign language" sense in the Pentecostal miracle, from 1520s. Tongue-tied is first recorded 1520s. To hold (one's) tongue "refrain from speaking" was in Old English.

**Body**
1. 助记,

2. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Old English bodig, of unknown origin.
**Etymology**
Old English bodig "trunk of a man or beast, physical structure of a human or animal; material frame, material existence of a human; main or principal part of anything," related to Old High German botah, but otherwise of unknown origin. Not elsewhere in Germanic, and the word has died out in German (replaced by Leib, originally "life," and Körper, from Latin), "but in English body remains as a great and important word" [OED].
	Extension to "a person, a human being" is from c. 1300. Meaning "main part" of anything was in late Old English, hence its use in reference to vehicles (1520s). From 1580s as **"part of the dress which covers the body."** From 1590s as "main part of a group, any number of individuals spoken of collectively." From 1660s as "main portion of a document." Contrasted with soul at least since mid-13c. Meaning "corpse" ("dead body") is from c. 1200. Transferred to matter generally in Middle English (as in heavenly body, late 14c.).
	Body politic "the nation, the state, whole body of people living under an organized government" first recorded late 15c., with French word order. Body image was coined 1934. Body count "number of enemy killed in battle or otherwise" is from 1968, from the Vietnam War. Body language is attested from 1967, perhaps from French langage corporel (1966). Body-snatcher "one who secretly disinters the bodies of the recently dead for dissection" is from 1834. Phrase over my dead body attested by 1833.

Probably from Old French joue **"cheek,"** originally jode, from Gallo-Romance *gauta or directly from Gaulish *gabata, but there are phonetic problems; or perhaps a variant of Germanic words related **to chew (v.);** compare also the two nouns jowl. Replaced Old English ceace, ceafl. Jaws as "holding and gripping part of an appliance" is from mid-15c.; figuratively, of time, death, defeat, etc., from 1560s.
