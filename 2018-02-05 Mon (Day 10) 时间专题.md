**OED Origin**
Late Middle English: from French chronique, via Latin from Greek khronikos ‘of time’, from khronos ‘time’.
**Etymology**
early 15c., of diseases, "lasting a long time," from Middle French chronique, from Latin chronicus, from Greek khronikos "of time, concerning time," from khronos "time" **(see chrono-**). Vague disapproving sense (from 17c.) is from association with diseases and later addictions. Literal sense "pertaining to time" is rare in English. As a popular slang catch-all word for "cannabis," popularized from 1992 by "The Chronic," an album released by rapper Dr. Dre; originally it described especially potent marijuana, on the notion of "extreme, severe." Related: Chronical; chronically.

**Time**
1. 词源,
From Proto-Germanic *timon- "time"
" Swedish timme "an hour"**
牛津词源的解释比较有意思,  related to **tide**, 古人从潮汐中获得对时间的最初的具象概念.
related to tide
**OED Origin**
Old English tīma, of Germanic origin; related to tide, which it superseded in temporal senses. The earliest of the current verb senses (dating from late Middle English) is ‘do (something) at a particular moment’.
**Etymology**
Old English tima **"limited space of time,"** from Proto-Germanic *timon- "time" (source also of Old Norse timi "time, proper time,**" Swedish timme "an hour"**), from **PIE *di-mon-, suffixed form of root *da- "to divide."**
Abstract sense of "time as an indefinite continuous duration" is recorded from late 14c. Personified at least since 1509 as an aged bald man (but with a forelock) carrying a scythe and an hour-glass. In English, a single word encompasses time as "extent" and "point" (French temps/fois, German zeit/mal) as well as "hour" (as in "what time is it?" compare French heure, German Uhr). Extended senses such as "occasion," "the right time," "leisure," or times (v.) "multiplied by" developed in Old and Middle English, probably as a natural outgrowth of such phrases as "He commends her a hundred times to God" (Old French La comande a Deu cent foiz).

牛津词典定义:

**Tide**/taɪd/
1. 词源,
时间time的词源, 
词源的考据先有time的时间含义,后由时间引申到潮水上. 潮水就是时间.
**OED Origin**
Old English tīd ‘time, period, era’, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch tijd and German Zeit, also to time. The sense relating to the sea dates from late Middle English.
**Etymology**
Old English tid "point or portion of time, due time, period, season; feast-day, canonical hour," from Proto-Germanic *tidiz "division of time" (source also of Old Saxon tid, Dutch tijd, Old High German zit, German Zeit "time"), from PIE *di-ti- "division, division of time," suffixed form of root *da- "to divide."
Meaning "rise and fall of the sea" (mid-14c.) probably is via notion of "fixed time," specifically "time of high water;" either a native evolution or from Middle Low German getide (compare Middle Dutch tijd, Dutch tij, German Gezeiten "flood tide, tide of the sea"). Old English seems to have had no specific word for this, using flod and ebba to refer to the rise and fall. Old English heahtid "high tide" meant "festival, high day."
2. 助记, tide, time, 将time具象到tide上.
3. 释义, 
1) Sea, 潮水, the rise and fall of the sea that happens twice every day
2) Change 潮流, 趋势

**Minute** /ˈmɪn.ɪt/
1. 词源,
前缀mini的词源, 
1)  from Latin minuta, noun use of fem. of minutus "little, small, minute,"
2) directly from Medieval Latin minuta "minute, short note,"
**OED Origin**
Late Middle English: via Old French from late Latin minuta, feminine (used as a noun) of minutus ‘made small’. The senses ‘period of sixty seconds’ and ‘sixtieth of a degree’ derive from medieval Latin pars minuta prima ‘first minute part’.
**Etymology**
"sixtieth part of an hour or degree," late 14c., from Old French minut (13c.) or directly from Medieval Latin minuta "minute, short note," from Latin minuta, noun use of fem. of minutus "little, small, minute," past participle of minuere "to lessen, diminish" (from PIE root ***mei- (2)** "small").
In Medieval Latin, pars minuta prima "first small part" was used by mathematician Ptolemy for one-sixtieth of a circle, later of an hour (next in order was secunda minuta, which became second (n.)). German Minute, Dutch minuut also are from French. Used vaguely for "short time" from late 14c. As a measure expressing distance (travel time) by 1886. Minute hand is attested from 1726.

**Hour**
1. 词源, 
Greek hora could mean "a season; '
The h- has persisted in this word despite not being pronounced since Roman times
hour是tid的变形.
**Origin**
Middle English: from Anglo-Norman French ure, via Latin from Greek hōra ‘season, hour’.
**Etymology**
The h- has persisted in this word despite not being pronounced since Roman times. **Replaced** Old English tid, literally "time" (see [tide](https://www.etymonline.com/word/tide?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.)) and stund "period of time, point of time, hour" (compare German Stunde "hour"). German Uhr also is from French.
Greek hora could mean "a season; 'the season' (spring or summer)." In classical times it sometimes meant "a part of the day," such as morning, evening, noon, night. The Greek astronomers apparently borrowed the notion of dividing the day into twelve parts (mentioned in Herodotus) from the Babylonians. **Night continued to be divided into four watches** (see [watch](https://www.etymonline.com/word/watch?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.)); but because the amount of daylight changed throughout the year, the hours were not fixed or of equal length.

2. 助记,  hour
3. 释义, hour


**Day**
1. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Old English dæg, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch dag and German Tag.
**Etymology**
Old English dæg "day," also "lifetime," from Proto-Germanic *dagaz "day" (source also of Old Saxon, Middle Dutch, Dutch dag, Old Frisian dei, Old High German tag, German Tag, Old Norse dagr, Gothic dags), according to Watkins, from PIE root *agh- "a day." He adds that the Germanic initial d- is "of obscure origin." Not considered to be related to Latin dies (from PIE root *dyeu- "to shine").
Meaning originally, in English, "the daylight hours;" expanded to mean "the 24-hour period" in late Anglo-Saxon times. The day formerly began at sunset, hence Old English Wodnesniht was what we would call "Tuesday night." Names of the weekdays were not regularly capitalized in English until 17c. Day off first recorded 1883; day-tripper first recorded 1897. The days in nowadays, etc. is a relic of the Old English and Middle English use of the adverbial genitive.
