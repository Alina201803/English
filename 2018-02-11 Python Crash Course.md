Python Crash Course
A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming


**Python**  /ˈpaɪ.θɑːn/  美式发音读起来很酷也很专业. 
1. 助记,
Python是编程语言的名字,没有任何实际意义,相当于张三李四.
是语言作者最喜欢的一个英国马戏团的名字,同时也是一种蟒蛇的名字.
我编了喜欢的名字:
Py(圆周率的π) + thon(song)
Py + Song.  圆周率之歌. Song of Py.

3. 释义,
1) 亲身实践的 (PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE)
Someone who has hands-on experience of something has done or used it rather than just read or learned about it.
2) 事事过问的，事必躬亲的 (INVOLVED)
Someone with a hands-on way of doing things becomes closely involved in managing and organizing things and in making decisions.
**Computing** Involving or requiring personal operation at a keyboard.

**Project** /ˈprɑː.dʒekt/ 项目
1. 助记
Pro(forwards) + ject(throw)
Project is Plan ,the thing you throw forwards to the future from today.
因此Projector是投影仪.
项目的定义的内涵和外延,广泛且庞杂(参考拓展)
但在计算机领域极为简单,Project是case(案例)的替代词汇.
比如写一个程序计算1+1 =2,可以说是一个计算1+1= 2的project或者program.
Python的完整且最为繁琐的一种代码写法如下:
```pyhton
result = 1 + 1
print(result)
```
2. 词源
Meaning **"scheme, proposal, mental plan"** 
 From Latin projectum ‘something prominent’,\
From pro- ‘forth’ + jacere ‘to throw’
**OED Origin**
Late Middle English (in the sense ‘preliminary design, tabulated statement’): from Latin projectum ‘something prominent’, neuter past participle of proicere ‘throw forth’, from pro- ‘forth’ + jacere ‘to throw’. Early senses of the verb were ‘plan’ and ‘cause to move forward’.

4. 拓展,
**PMBOK** 美国项目管理协会的定义
> A project is a **temporary** endeavor undertaken to create **a unique product, service, or result.**   
> 项目定义的三个特性:  
> 1) The **temporary** nature of projects (临时性)  
> indicates that a project has a definite beginning and end. The end is reached when the project’s objectives have been achieved or when the project is terminated because its objectives will not or cannot be met, or when the need for the project no longer exists. A project may also be terminated if the client (customer, sponsor, or champion) wishes to terminate the project. Temporary does not necessarily mean the duration of the project is short. It refers to the project’s engagement and its longevity. Temporary does not typically apply to the product, service, or result created by the project; most projects are undertaken to create a lasting outcome. For example, a project to build a national monument will create a result expected to last for centuries. Projects can also have social, economic, and environmental impacts that far outlive the projects themselves.  
> 2) Every project creates a **unique product, service, or result.** (Deliverable, 可交付性)  
> The **outcome** of the project may be tangible or intangible. Although repetitive elements may be present in some project deliverables and activities, this repetition does not change the fundamental, unique characteristics of the project work. For example, office buildings can be constructed with the same or similar materials and by the same or different teams. However, each building project remains unique with a different location, different design, different circumstances and situations, different stakeholders, and so on.  
> 3) **Unique**(独特性)  
> An ongoing work effort is generally a repetitive process that follows an organization’s existing procedures. In contrast, because of the unique nature of projects, there may be uncertainties or differences in the products, services, or results that the project creates. Project activities can be new to members of a project team, which may necessitate more dedicated planning than other routine work. In addition, projects are undertaken at all organizational levels. A project can involve a single individual or multiple individuals, a single organizational unit, or multiple organizational units from multiple organizations.  
**Wikipedia**
> In contemporary business and science, a project is an individual or collaborative enterprise, possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned, usually by a project team, to achieve a particular aim.[1]  
> A project may also be a set of interrelated tasks to be executed over a fixed period and within certain cost and other limitations.[2]  
> It may be a temporary (rather than permanent) social systems as work systems that is constituted by teams within or across organizations to accomplish particular tasks under time constraints.[3] A project may be a part of a wider programme management

Programming:
维基百科中的详细定义.
[Computer programming - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming)	
> Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding[1][2]) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.
