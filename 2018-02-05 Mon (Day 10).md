**OED Origin**
Late Middle English: from French chronique, via Latin from Greek khronikos ‘of time’, from khronos ‘time’.
**Etymology**
early 15c., of diseases, "lasting a long time," from Middle French chronique, from Latin chronicus, from Greek khronikos "of time, concerning time," from khronos "time" **(see chrono-**). Vague disapproving sense (from 17c.) is from association with diseases and later addictions. Literal sense "pertaining to time" is rare in English. As a popular slang catch-all word for "cannabis," popularized from 1992 by "The Chronic," an album released by rapper Dr. Dre; originally it described especially potent marijuana, on the notion of "extreme, severe." Related: Chronical; chronically.

> **OED Origin**

**Time**
1. 词源,
From Proto-Germanic *timon- "time"
" Swedish timme "an hour"**
牛津词源的解释比较有意思,  related to **tide**, 古人从潮汐中获得对时间的最初的具象概念.
related to tide
**OED Origin**
Old English tīma, of Germanic origin; related to tide, which it superseded in temporal senses. The earliest of the current verb senses (dating from late Middle English) is ‘do (something) at a particular moment’.
**Etymology**
Old English tima **"limited space of time,"** from Proto-Germanic *timon- "time" (source also of Old Norse timi "time, proper time,**" Swedish timme "an hour"**), from **PIE *di-mon-, suffixed form of root *da- "to divide."**
Abstract sense of "time as an indefinite continuous duration" is recorded from late 14c. Personified at least since 1509 as an aged bald man (but with a forelock) carrying a scythe and an hour-glass. In English, a single word encompasses time as "extent" and "point" (French temps/fois, German zeit/mal) as well as "hour" (as in "what time is it?" compare French heure, German Uhr). Extended senses such as "occasion," "the right time," "leisure," or times (v.) "multiplied by" developed in Old and Middle English, probably as a natural outgrowth of such phrases as "He commends her a hundred times to God" (Old French La comande a Deu cent foiz).

3. 释义,
1) 时间, (MINUTES/DAYS/YEARS)
The part of existence that is measured in minutes, days, years, etc., or this process considered as a whole
牛津词典定义:
The indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole.

**Tide**/taɪd/
1. 词源,
时间time的词源, 
词源的考据先有time的时间含义,后由时间引申到潮水上. 潮水就是时间.
**OED Origin**
Old English tīd ‘time, period, era’, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch tijd and German Zeit, also to time. The sense relating to the sea dates from late Middle English.
**Etymology**
Old English tid "point or portion of time, due time, period, season; feast-day, canonical hour," from Proto-Germanic *tidiz "division of time" (source also of Old Saxon tid, Dutch tijd, Old High German zit, German Zeit "time"), from PIE *di-ti- "division, division of time," suffixed form of root *da- "to divide."
Meaning "rise and fall of the sea" (mid-14c.) probably is via notion of "fixed time," specifically "time of high water;" either a native evolution or from Middle Low German getide (compare Middle Dutch tijd, Dutch tij, German Gezeiten "flood tide, tide of the sea"). Old English seems to have had no specific word for this, using flod and ebba to refer to the rise and fall. Old English heahtid "high tide" meant "festival, high day."
2. 助记, tide, time, 将time具象到tide上.
3. 释义, 
1) Sea, 潮水, the rise and fall of the sea that happens twice every day
2) Change 潮流, 趋势

**Minute** /ˈmɪn.ɪt/
1. 词源,
前缀mini的词源, 
1)  from Latin minuta, noun use of fem. of minutus "little, small, minute,"
2) directly from Medieval Latin minuta "minute, short note,"
**OED Origin**
Late Middle English: via Old French from late Latin minuta, feminine (used as a noun) of minutus ‘made small’. The senses ‘period of sixty seconds’ and ‘sixtieth of a degree’ derive from medieval Latin pars minuta prima ‘first minute part’.
**Etymology**
"sixtieth part of an hour or degree," late 14c., from Old French minut (13c.) or directly from Medieval Latin minuta "minute, short note," from Latin minuta, noun use of fem. of minutus "little, small, minute," past participle of minuere "to lessen, diminish" (from PIE root ***mei- (2)** "small").
In Medieval Latin, pars minuta prima "first small part" was used by mathematician Ptolemy for one-sixtieth of a circle, later of an hour (next in order was secunda minuta, which became second (n.)). German Minute, Dutch minuut also are from French. Used vaguely for "short time" from late 14c. As a measure expressing distance (travel time) by 1886. Minute hand is attested from 1726.
2. 助记, minute

**Hour**
1. 词源, 
Greek hora could mean "a season; '
The h- has persisted in this word despite not being pronounced since Roman times
hour是tid的变形.
**Origin**
Middle English: from Anglo-Norman French ure, via Latin from Greek hōra ‘season, hour’.
**Etymology**
The h- has persisted in this word despite not being pronounced since Roman times. **Replaced** Old English tid, literally "time" (see [tide](https://www.etymonline.com/word/tide?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.)) and stund "period of time, point of time, hour" (compare German Stunde "hour"). German Uhr also is from French.
Greek hora could mean "a season; 'the season' (spring or summer)." In classical times it sometimes meant "a part of the day," such as morning, evening, noon, night. The Greek astronomers apparently borrowed the notion of dividing the day into twelve parts (mentioned in Herodotus) from the Babylonians. **Night continued to be divided into four watches** (see [watch](https://www.etymonline.com/word/watch?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.)); but because the amount of daylight changed throughout the year, the hours were not fixed or of equal length.

2. 助记,  hour
3. 释义, hour


**Day**
1. 词源,
**OED Origin**
Old English dæg, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch dag and German Tag.
**Etymology**
Old English dæg "day," also "lifetime," from Proto-Germanic *dagaz "day" (source also of Old Saxon, Middle Dutch, Dutch dag, Old Frisian dei, Old High German tag, German Tag, Old Norse dagr, Gothic dags), according to Watkins, from PIE root *agh- "a day." He adds that the Germanic initial d- is "of obscure origin." Not considered to be related to Latin dies (from PIE root *dyeu- "to shine").
Meaning originally, in English, "the daylight hours;" expanded to mean "the 24-hour period" in late Anglo-Saxon times. The day formerly began at sunset, hence Old English Wodnesniht was what we would call "Tuesday night." Names of the weekdays were not regularly capitalized in English until 17c. Day off first recorded 1883; day-tripper first recorded 1897. The days in nowadays, etc. is a relic of the Old English and Middle English use of the adverbial genitive.
2. 助记, day, to shine(关联到dazzle, dazzling闪亮耀眼的)
3. 释义,

liberal arts
noun [ plural ] UK ​  /ˌlɪb.ər.əl ˈɑːts/ US ​  /ˌlɪb.ər.əl ˈɑːrts/ 
​1、词源：
late 14c., translating Latin artes liberales; the name for the seven attainments directed to intellectual enlargement, rather than immediate practical purpose, and thus deemed worthy of a free man (liberal in this sense is opposed to servile or mechanical). They were divided into the trivium -- grammar, logic, rhetoric (see trivial) -- and the quadrivium -- arithmetic, geometry, music, astronomy. Explained by Fowler (1926) as "the education designed for a gentleman (Latin liber a free man) & ... opposed on the one hand to technical or professional or any special training, & on the other to education that stops short before manhood is reached."

The study of [the classics] is fitly called a liberal education, because it emancipates the mind from every narrow provincialism, whether of egoism or tradition, and is the apprenticeship that every one must serve before becoming a free brother of the guild which passes the torch of life from age to age. [James Russell Lowell, "Among my Books"]
2、助记：liberal
3、词典：college or university subjects, such as history, languages, and literature, that develop students' general education rather than preparing them for a particular job
（大学的）文科

Liberal Arts 在英美的教育体系中含义很明确，主要是指专业训练之外的，提高人整体教育素养、学习能力和基础知识的文理课程，包括数学、自然科学和人文学科的教育。在此之上才是工程、医学、法律、商业等具体的专业。

**Liberal**自由女神像 Statue of Liberty
1. 词源
源自法语, Old French from Latin liberalis, from liber ‘free (man)’.
**Origin**
Middle English: via Old French from Latin liberalis, from liber ‘free (man)’. The original sense was ‘suitable for a free man’, hence ‘suitable for a gentleman’ (one not tied to a trade), surviving in liberal arts. Another early sense ‘generous’ (compare with liberal (sense 4 of the adjective)) gave rise to an obsolete meaning ‘free from restraint’, leading to liberal (sense 1 of the adjective) (late 18th century).

**Free**
1. 词源
源自古英语.
"exempt from;
可以理解为 from exempt的缩写.
**Origin**
Old English frēo (adjective), frēon (verb), of Germanic origin; related to Dutch vrij and German frei, from an Indo-European root meaning ‘to love’, shared by friend.
**Etymology**
Old English freo "exempt from; not in bondage, acting of one's own will," also "noble; joyful," from Proto-Germanic *frija- "beloved; not in bondage" (source also of Old Frisian fri, Old Saxon vri, Old High German vri, German frei, Dutch vrij, Gothic freis "free"), from PIE *priy-a- "dear, beloved," from root *pri- "to love" (source also of Sanskrit priyah "own, dear, beloved," priyate "loves;" Old Church Slavonic prijati "to help," prijatelji "friend;" Welsh rhydd "free").

> **ode (n.)**  
> 1580s, from Middle French ode (c. 1500), from Late Latin ode "lyric song," from Greek oide, Attic contraction of aoide "song, ode;" related to aeidein (Attic aidein) "to sing;" aoidos (Attic oidos) "a singer, singing;" aude "voice, tone, sound," probably from a PIE *e-weid-, perhaps from root *wed- "to speak."

**Vitamin**
```python
其实早在vitamin被发现之前，人们就已经开始认识到缺乏某种物质会带来疾病，并用食补来治疗：古埃及用动物肝脏来治疗夜盲；新鲜水果和蔬菜被用来治疗长期航海时出现的坏血症。

然而真正促成vitamin被发现的其实是beriberi，脚气病。beri是僧伽罗（斯里兰卡的一个当地种族）语，意思为“weakness”，beriberi就是加倍的“虚弱”。当时在东亚地区，精白米是主要的食物，当地脚气病盛行。

一个在英国学习过的日本医生Takaki发现：在低阶级的人群中脚气病更常见，他们的食物每天几乎只有白米；而在食谱更接近西方习惯的高级军官中间，脚气病很少见。于是他做了个简单的对照试验，一组人只吃白米，另一组是鸡鸭蛋奶豆和米，实验结果“强阳”。可惜Takaki错误的认为是丰富的蛋白质预防了脚气病的发生。

1912年波兰化学家Casimir Funk分离出来了可以预防脚气病的维生素物质硫胺素（thiamine），命名之vitamine="vital amine"，即生命必要的胺类物质。但是随着越来越多的维生素被发现，并不是所有的都是amine（胺类），然而vitamine这个称呼的使用已经很广泛，人们就将最后一个e去掉，变成vitamin，从而减弱amine的影响。

1. 词源, 
French from Latin gratia, from gratus ‘pleasing, thankful’; related to grateful.
词根gra的含义是感恩,  著名的赞美诗歌曲, amazing grace.
**OED Origin**
Middle English: via Old French from Latin gratia, from gratus ‘pleasing, thankful’; related to grateful.
**Etymology**
late 12c., "God's unmerited favor, love, or help," from Old French grace "pardon, divine grace, mercy; favor, thanks; elegance, virtue" (12c., Modern French grâce), from Latin gratia "favor, esteem, regard; pleasing quality, good will, **gratitude"** (source of Italian grazia, Spanish gracia; in Church use translating Greek kharisma), from gratus "pleasing, agreeable,**" from PIE *gwreto-, suffixed form of root *gwere- (2) "to favor."
Sense of "virtue" is early 14c., that of "beauty of form or movement, pleasing quality" is mid-14c. In classical sense, "one of the three sister goddesses (Latin Gratiæ, Greek Kharites), bestowers of beauty and charm," it is first recorded in English 1579 in Spenser. In music, "an embellishment not essential to the melody or harmony," 1650s. As the name of the short prayer that is said before or after a meal (early 13c.; until 16c. usually graces) it has a sense of "gratitude." As a title of honor, c. 1500.

**Breath** 动词 breathe
1. 词源, 
源自古英语 bræð "odor, scent, stink, exhalation, vapor"
**OED Origin**
Old English brǣth ‘smell, scent’, of Germanic origin; related to brood.
**Etymology**
Old English bræð "odor, scent, stink, exhalation, vapor" (Old English word for "air exhaled from the lungs" was æðm), from Proto-Germanic *bræthaz "smell, exhalation" (source also of Old High German bradam, German Brodem "breath, steam"), perhaps from a PIE root *gwhre- "to breathe; smell."
The original long vowel (preserved in breathe) has become short. Meaning "ability to breathe," hence "life" is from c. 1300. Meaning "a single act of breathing" is from late 15c.; sense of "the duration of a breath, a moment, a short time" is from early 13c. Meaning "a breeze, a movement of free air" is from late 14c.

### 对比单词respire和breathe

respire源自法语和拉丁语, 而breathe源自土鳖的古英语
因此,respire是一个更高级的词汇. 
后面跟呼吸相关的造字,也都采用respire的词根词干, 直接取其在拉丁语中的含义.

总结,在以后的书面沟通中,要把breathe这个呼吸彻底忘掉,全部替换成respire.
