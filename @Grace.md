**Suspect** v. /səˈspɛkt/ n. adj. /ˈsʌspɛkt/

1. 助记,

   sus(表示“在下，向上”)+spect(v.怀疑；n.被怀疑者，嫌疑犯)

   suspect : [sus-(sub-)=under在……下面；(s)pect=to look 看→“to look at someone from under or askance私下斜眼看某人”→]，与suspicion同义。

   spect，词源同spectate，respect，词根为spek-“to observe”

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Middle English (originally as an adjective): from Latin suspectus ‘mistrusted’, past participle of suspicere, from sub- ‘from below’ + specere ‘to look’.
   **Etymology**

   early 14c., "suspected of wrongdoing, under suspicion;" mid-14c., "regarded with mistrust, liable to arouse suspicion," from Old French suspect (14c.), from Latin suspectus "suspected, regarded with suspicion or mistrust," past participle of suspicere "look up at, look upward," figuratively "look up to, admire, respect;" also "look at secretly, look askance at," hence, figuratively, "mistrust, regard with suspicion," from assimilated form of sub "up to" (see [sub-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/sub-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + specere "to look at" (from PIE root [*spek-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*spek-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to observe"). The notion behind the word is "look at secretly," hence, "look at distrustfully."
