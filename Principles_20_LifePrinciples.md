# Part 2: Life Principles



## 1 Embrace Reality and Deal With It



There is nothing more important than understanding **how reality works and how to deal with it.** The state of mind you bring to this process makes all the difference. I **have found it helpful to think of my life as if it were a game in which each problem I face is a puzzle I need to solve.** By solving the puzzle, I get a **gem** in the form of a principle that helps me avoid the same sort of problem in the future. Collecting these gems continually improves my decision making, so I am able to **ascend** to higher and higher levels of play in which the game gets harder and the **stakes** become ever greater.

All sorts of **emotions** come to me while I am playing and those emotions can either help me or hurt me. If I can **reconcile** my emotions with my logic and only act when they are **aligned**, I make better decisions.

**Learning how reality works, visualizing the things I want to create, and then building them out is incredibly exciting to me.** **Stretching** for big goals puts me in the position of failing and needing to learn and come up with new inventions in order to move forward. I find it **exhilarating** being caught up **in the feedback loop of rapid learning**—just as a surfer loves riding a wave, even though it sometimes leads to crashes. Don’t get me wrong, I’m still scared of the crashes and I still find them painful. But I keep that pain in perspective, knowing that I will get through these **setbacks** and that most of my learning will come from **reflecting on** them.  Just as long-distance runners push through pain to experience the pleasure of “runner’s high,” I have largely gotten past the pain of my mistake making and instead enjoy the pleasure that comes with learning from it. I believe that with practice you can change your habits and experience the same “mistake learner’s high.”

2. 词源

   **Origin**

   Old English gim, from Latin gemma ‘bud, jewel’; influenced in Middle English by Old French gemme.

   **Etymology**

   "a precious stone" (especially when cut or polished), c. 1300, probably from Old French gemme (12c.), from Latin gemma "precious stone, jewel," originally "bud," from Proto-Italic *gebma- "bud, sprout," from PIE *geb-m- "sprout, bud" (source also of Lithuanian žembėti "to germinate, sprout," Old Church Slavonic prozebnoti "to germinate").The two competing traditional etymologies trace it either to the root [*gembh-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*gembh-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "tooth, nail" [Watkins] or *gem- "'to press." De Vaan finds the second "semantically unconvincing" and leans toward the first despite the difficult sense connection.Of persons, "a rare or excellent example (of something)" from late 13c. Alternative forms iemme, gimme persisted into 14c. and might represent a survival of Old English gimm "precious stone, gem, jewel," also "eye," which was borrowed directly from Latin gemma.
