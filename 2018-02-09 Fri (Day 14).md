enthusiasm（热情）：神灵附体时的狂热情感
英语单词enthusiasm原本是一个宗教词汇，来自希腊语enthousiazein，本意就是“神灵附体、受到神灵的启发”，后来被用来表示“自认为与神有某种特殊联系而产生过度强烈的宗教情感”。
二十世纪后，该词的宗教色彩逐渐消失，用来表示“对某事物的特别热衷、热情”。
enthusiast：[ɪn'θuzɪæst] n.狂热者，热心人，爱好者
enthusiastic：[ɪn,θjuːzɪ'æstɪk; en-] adj.热情的，热心的，狂热的
passion：激情、酷爱
> 我一向是一个缺乏enthusiasm的人，看到“神灵附体时的热情”这个解释却是让我一阵激动，希望可以“神灵附体时的热情”去学习和做任何事~~~

Late 16th century (denoting a box for money): from Old French casse or Italian cassa ‘box’, from Latin capsa (see case).

1590s, **"money box;"** also "money in hand, coin," from Middle French caisse "money box" (16c.), from Provençal caissa or Italian cassa, from Latin capsa "box" (see case (n.2)); originally the money box, but by 18c. the secondary sense of the money in it became sole meaning.

Slightly earlier in Englished formeuthanasy (1630s). Sense of "legally sanctioned mercy killing" is recorded in English by 1869.
> **thanato-**  
> before vowels thanat-, word-forming element meaning "death," from Greek thanatos "death," from PIE ***dhwene- "to disappear**, die," perhaps from a root meaning "dark, cloudy" (compare Sanskrit dhvantah "dark"). Hence Bryant's "Thanatopsis", with Greek opsis "a sight, view."  
3. 助记, 
from eu ‘well’ + thanatos ‘death’.
拼写上可以胡诌, Eu(欧洲) + than + asia. 欧洲比亚洲适合安乐死.

**光系列**
Diffraction feature of photons is the theoretical basis that we can receive the cellphone signal in the house even closing all the windows and doors.
Diffract 衍射 to break up light or sound waves by making them go through a narrow space or across an edge
Early 19th century: from Latin diffract- ‘broken in pieces’, from the verb diffringere, from dis- ‘away, from’ + frangere ‘to break’.
信号和光有啥关系，该系列走到这大家现在应该意识到我们所说的光都是广义上的电磁波。由于门窗总有缝且部分材质特性不能屏蔽电磁波，通过衍射，我们能在墙后收到到wifi信号，在室内收到手机信号，甚至在地下车库收到无线电广播信号（波长更长），而第一张DNA双螺旋图是谁也看不懂的X光衍射图。
