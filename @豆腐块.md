   **Etymology**

   early 15c., "creed, summary, religious belief," from Late Latin symbolum "creed, token, mark," from Greek symbolon "token, watchword, sign by which one infers; ticket, a permit, licence" (the word was applied c.250 by Cyprian of Carthage to the Apostles' Creed, on the notion of the "mark" that distinguishes Christians from pagans), literally "that which is thrown or cast together," **from assimilated form of syn- "together" (see [syn-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/syn-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + bole "a throwing, a casting, the stroke of a missile, bolt, beam,"** from bol-, nominative stem of ballein "to throw" (from PIE root [*gwele-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*gwele-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to throw, reach").The sense evolution in Greek is from "throwing things together" to "contrasting" to "comparing" to "token used in comparisons to determine if something is genuine." Hence, "outward sign" of something. The meaning "something which stands for something else" first recorded 1590 (in "Faerie Queene"). As a written character, 1610s.

   指南针,是指导如何一步一步的走完行程.

2. 词源,

   **OED Origin**

   Middle English: from Old Frech compas (noun), compasser (verb), based on Latin com- ‘together’ + passus ‘a step or pace’. Several senses (‘measure’, ‘artifice’, ‘circumscribed area’, and ‘pair of compasses’) which appeared in Middle English are also found in Old French, but their development and origin are uncertain. The transference of sense to the magnetic compass is held to have occurred in the related Italian word compasso, from the circular shape of the compass box.

   **Etymology**

   c. 1300, "space, area, extent, circumference," from Old French compas "circle, radius; size, extent; pair of compasses" (12c.), from compasser "to go around, measure (with a compass); divide equally," from Vulgar Latin *compassare "to pace out," from Latin com "with, together" (see [com-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/com-?ref=etymonline_crossreference)) + passus "a step" (from PIE root [*pete-](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*pete-?ref=etymonline_crossreference) "to spread").The mathematical instrument for describing circles was so called in English from mid-14c. The mariners' directional tool (so called since early 15c.) took the name, perhaps, because it's round and has a point like the mathematical instrument.Meaning "limits, boundary" is from 1550s. Sense of "range of notes which a given voice or instrument can produce" is from 1590s. The word is in most European languages, with a mathematical sense in Romance, a nautical sense in Germanic, and both in English. In Middle English it also could mean "ingenuity, subtlety, cunning." Also an adverb in Middle English: to go compass was "go in a circle, go around."

   *slick (v.)*

   Old English -slician (in nigslicod "newly made sleek"), from Proto-Germanic *slikojan, from base *slikaz (source also of Old Norse slikr "smooth," Old High German slihhan "to glide," German schleichen "to creep, crawl, sneak," Dutch slijk "mud, mire"), from PIE *sleig- "to smooth, glide, be muddy," from root *(s)lei- "slimy" (see [slime](https://www.etymonline.com/word/slime?ref=etymonline_crossreference) (n.)).

   [Parameter - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter)

   **Computer programming**

   In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming), two notions of [parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)) are commonly used, and are referred to as [parameters and arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Parameters_and_arguments)—or more formally as a **formal parameter** and an **actual parameter**.

   For example, in the definition of a function such as

   `y = f(x) = x + 2,`


   *x* is the *formal parameter* (the *parameter*) of the defined function.

   When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in

   `f(3): or, y = f(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,`


    is the *actual parameter* (the *argument*) for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the *formal parameter* of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms *parameter* and *argument* might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)

   These concepts are discussed in a more precise way in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and its foundational disciplines, [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) and [combinatory logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatory_logic). Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) define parameter and argument as given here, while [Eiffel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiffel_(programming_language)) uses an [alternative convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter_(computer_programming)#Alternative_convention_in_Eiffel).

   In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.

   >
   > Parameters appear in procedure definitions; arguments appear in procedure calls. In the function definition `f(x) = x*x` the variable x is a parameter; in the function call `f(2)` the value 2 is the argument of the function. **Loosely, a parameter is a type, and an argument is an instance.**

    **Mathematical functions[[edit source](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parameter&action=edit&section=1)]**

   [Mathematical functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_function) have one or more [arguments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_of_a_function) that are designated in the definition by [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(mathematics)). A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general [quadratic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function) by declaring


   here, the variable *x* designates the function's argument, but *a*, *b*, and *c* are parameters that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-*b* logarithm by the formula
