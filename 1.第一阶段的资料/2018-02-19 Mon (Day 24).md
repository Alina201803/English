**Squirrel**  /ˈskwɝː.əl/
1. 释义
a small animal covered in fur with a long tail. Squirrels climb trees and feed on nuts and seeds.
松鼠、贮藏
2. 词源
early 14c., from Anglo-French esquirel, Old French escurueil "squirrel; squirrel fur" (Modern French écureuil), from Vulgar Latin *scuriolus, diminutive of *scurius "squirrel," variant of Latin sciurus, from Greek skiouros "a squirrel," literally "shadow-tailed," from skia "shadow" (see Ascians) + oura "tail," from PIE root *ors- "buttocks, backside" (see arse). Perhaps the original notion is "that which makes a shade with its tail," but Beekes writes that this "looks like a folk etymology rather than a serious explanation." The Old English word was acweorna, which survived into Middle English as aquerne.
来自盎格鲁法语esquirel,来自古法语escurueil,来自拉丁语sciurus,来自希腊语skiouros,松鼠，来自skia,影子， oura,尾巴，屁股，词源同arse。因松鼠巨大的尾巴而得名。
3. 助记
"to hoard up, store away" (as a squirrel does nuts), 1939, from squirrel (n.). Related: Squirreled; squirreling. 
squirrel cageadj. 鼠笼式的
ground squirrel[动]地松鼠
flying squirrel[动]鼯鼠
store/ reposit vt.贮藏

> 我今天学这个词也挺有意思的，一个词同时代表松鼠和贮藏，贮藏就像松鼠把松果囤积藏起来一样，让这个词也立马生动起来。

psychiatry  /saɪˈkaɪə.tri
1. 释义, 
the part of medicine thatstudies mental illness精神病学
2. 词源1846, 
from French psychiatrie, from Medieval Latin psychiatria, literally "a healing of the soul," from Latinized form of Greek psykhe- "mind" (see psyche) + iatreia"healing, care" (see -iatric).
助记:Psychiatry一开始是古希腊古代朴素唯物主义的各位大大们弄出来的，打头的就是有名的希波克拉底。古希腊人，就像很多后来的学者一样，认为人是有灵魂的，这个灵魂叫做ψυχή（psyche），它来自呼吸，因为人们认为灵魂与呼吸相关，有意思的是，拉丁文的灵魂spiritus（衍生如spirit）其实也和spiro呼吸（respire呼吸，conspire共谋）相关。

iatria则来自ίατήρ，医生，治疗师，所以“医源性”除了nosocomial还有一个说法是iatrogenic，其中genic，产生的
