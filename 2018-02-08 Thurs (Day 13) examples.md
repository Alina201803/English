literally "a falling," from cas-, past participle stem of cadere
**OED Origin**
Middle English: from Old French cas, from Latin casus ‘fall’, related to cadere ‘to fall’; in case (sense 4) directly from Latin, translating Greek ptōsis, literally ‘fall’.
**Etymology**
early 13c., **"what befalls one; state of affairs,"** from Old French cas "an event, happening, situation, quarrel, trial," from Latin **casus** "a chance, occasion, opportunity; accident, mishap," **literally "a falling,"** from cas-, past participle stem of cadere "to fall, sink, settle down, decline, perish" (used widely: of the setting of heavenly bodies, the fall of Troy, suicides), **from PIE root *kad- "to fall."**
	The notion is of **"that which falls" as "that which happens" (compare befall).** From its general nature, the word has taken on widespread extended and transferred meanings. Meaning "instance, example" is from c. 1300. Meaning "actual state of affairs" is from c. 1400. In law, "an instance of litigation" (late 14c.); in medicine, "an instance of a disease" (late 14c.). The grammatical sense, "one of the forms which make up the inflections of a noun" (late 14c.) also was in Latin.
	U.S. slang meaning "person" (especially one peculiar or remarkable in any way) is from 1848. Meaning "incident or series of events requiring police investigation" is from 1838. In case "in the event" is recorded from mid-14c. Case-history is from 1879, originally medical; case-study "study of a particular case" is from 1879, originally legal; case-law "law as settled by previous court cases" is from 1861.

2. 词源, 
ad- ‘towards, to’ + cadere ‘to fall’
**Origin**
Late Middle English (in the general sense ‘an event’): via Old French from Latin accident- ‘happening’, from the verb accidere, from ad- ‘towards, to’ + cadere ‘to fall’.
**Etymology**
late 14c., "an occurrence, incident, event; what comes by chance," from Old French accident (12c.), from Latin accidentem (nominative accidens) "an occurrence; chance; misfortune," noun use of present participle of accidere "happen, fall out, fall upon," from ad "to" (see ad-) + combining form of cadere "to fall," from PIE root *kad- "to fall."
	The sense has had a tendency since Latin to extend from "something that happens, an event" to "mishap, undesirable event." Latin si quid cui accidat, "if anything should happen to one," was a euphemism for "to die." In Middle English the word is usually met in theology (in reference to the material qualities in the sacramental bread and wine), medicine ("something out of the ordinary, disease, injury"), or philosophy ("non-essential characteristic of a thing"). From late 15c. as "the operations of chance." Meaning "unplanned child" is attested by 1932. Accident-prone is from 1926.

A doublet of chance (n.).
The notion is of a "fall" in the voice in reading aloud or speaking, as at the end of a sentence, also the rising and falling in modulation of tones in reciting.

**Chance**

2. 词源,
From cheoir ‘fall, befall’, based on Latin cadere
**OED Origin**
Middle English: from Old French cheance, from cheoir ‘fall, befall’, based on Latin cadere.
**Etymology**
c. 1300, "something that takes place, what happens, an occurrence" (good or bad, but more often bad), especially one that is unexpected, unforeseen, or beyond human control, **also "one's luck, lot, or fortune**," good or bad, in a positive sense "opportunity, favorable contingency;" also "contingent or unexpected event, something that may or may not come about or be realized," from Old French cheance "accident, chance, fortune, luck, situation, the falling of dice" (12c., Modern French chance), from Vulgar Latin *cadentia "that which falls out," a term used in dice, from neuter plural of Latin cadens, **present participle of cadere "to fall," from PIE root *kad- "to fall."**
	In English frequently in plural, chances. The word's notions of "opportunity" and "randomness" are as old as the record of it in English and now all but crowd out its original notion of "mere occurrence." Meaning "fortuity, absence of any cause why an event should happen or turn out as it does, variability viewed as a real agent" is from c. 1400.
	Main chance **"probability** that offers greatest advantage," hence "thing of most importance" is from 1570s. Mathematical sense "probability, likelihood of a certain outcome" is from 1778, hence the odds-making sense "balanced probability of gain or loss." To stand a chance (or not) is from 1796. To take (one's) chances "accept what happens" (early 14c.) is from the old, neutral sense; to take a chance/take chances is originally (by 1814) "participate in a raffle or lottery or game;" extended sense of "take a risk" is by 1826.
